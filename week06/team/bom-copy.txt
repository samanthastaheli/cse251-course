THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI
 HIS REIGN AND MINISTRY
 An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and his four sons, being
 called, (beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi.
 The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem,
 because he prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity
 and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days' journey
 into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren
 and returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the
 Jews. The account of their sufferings. They take the daughters of
 Ishmael to wife. They take their families and depart into the
 wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness.
 The course of their travels. They come to the large waters.
 Nephi's brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and
 buildeth a ship. They call the name of the place Bountiful. They
 cross the large waters into the promised land, and so forth. This
 is according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, I,
 Nephi, wrote this record.
 
 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was
 taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen
 many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having
 been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a
 great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God,
 therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.
 
 Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which
 consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the
 Egyptians.
 
 And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it
 with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
 
 For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of
 the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having
 dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there
 came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must
 repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.
 
 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went
 forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in
 behalf of his people.
 
 And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a
 pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and
 heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he
 did quake and tremble exceedingly.
 
 And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at
 Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with
 the Spirit and the things which he had seen.
 
 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away
 in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he
 saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless
 concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising
 their God.
 
 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the
 midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of
 the sun at noon-day.
 
 And he also saw twelve others following him, and their
 brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.
 
 And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth;
 and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him
 a book, and bade him that he should read.
 
 And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the
 Spirit of the Lord.
 
 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen
 thine abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read
 concerning Jerusalem--that it should be destroyed, and the
 inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many
 should be carried away captive into Babylon.
 
 And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen
 many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto
 the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God
 Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and
 goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth,
 and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who
 come unto thee that they shall perish!
 
 And after this manner was the language of my father in the
 praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole
 heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea,
 which the Lord had shown unto him.
 
 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things
 which my father hath written, for he hath written many things
 which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written
 many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of
 which I shall not make a full account.
 
 But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days.
 Behold, I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon
 plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I
 have abridged the record of my father then will I make an account
 of mine own life.
 
 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord
 had shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea,
 concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth
 among the people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto them
 concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.
 
 And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the
 things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of
 their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that
 the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he
 read in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of the
 Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.
 
 And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with
 him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast
 out, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that
 they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto
 you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom
 he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even
 unto the power of deliverance.
 
 
 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my
 father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou
 Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because
 thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things
 which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in
 a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the
 wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the
 Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.
 
 And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And
 he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold,
 and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with
 him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and
 departed into the wilderness.
 
 And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea;
 and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer
 the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family,
 which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who
 were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.
 
 And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in
 the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a
 river of water.
 
 And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made
 an offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.
 
 And it came to pass that he called the name of the river,
 Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the
 borders near the mouth thereof.
 
 And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied
 into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O
 that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running
 into the fountain of all righteousness!
 
 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like
 unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping
 the commandments of the Lord!
 
 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and
 Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many things against their
 father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of
 the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance,
 and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to
 perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because
 of the foolish imaginations of his heart.
 
 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur
 against their father. And they did murmur because they knew not
 the dealings of that God who had created them.
 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city,
 could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And
 they were like unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to
 take away the life of my father.
 
 And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the
 valley of Lemuel, with power, being filled with the Spirit, until
 their frames did shake before him. And he did confound them,
 that they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he
 commanded them.
 
 And my father dwelt in a tent.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young,
 nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great
 desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry
 unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my
 heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by
 my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my
 brothers.
 
 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which
 the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came
 to pass that he believed in my words.
 
 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my
 words; and being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts
 I cried unto the Lord for them.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying:
 Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast
 sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.
 
 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall
 prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land
 which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above
 all other lands.
 
 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they
 shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.
 
 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt
 be made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.
 
 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, I
 will curse them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no
 power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also.
 
 And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a
 scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of
 remembrance.
 
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with
 the Lord, to the tent of my father.
 
 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I
 have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me
 that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.
 
 For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a
 genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of
 brass.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy
 brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records,
 and bring them down hither into the wilderness.
 
 And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing
 which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it
 of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.
 
 Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord,
 because thou hast not murmured.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will
 go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know
 that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men,
 save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the
 thing which he commandeth them.
 
 And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words
 he was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of
 the Lord.
 
 And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the
 wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.
 
 And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of
 Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.
 
 And we cast lots--who of us should go in unto the house of
 Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and
 Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as
 he sat in his house.
 
 And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon
 the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father.
 
 And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust
 him out from his presence; and he would not that he should have
 the records. Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a
 robber, and I will slay thee.
 
 But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which
 Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly
 sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in
 the wilderness.
 
 But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as
 we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness
 until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath
 commanded us.
 
 Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of
 the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father's
 inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner
 of riches. And all this he hath done because of the commandments
 of the Lord.
 
 For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the
 wickedness of the people.
 
 For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets.
 Wherefore, if my father should dwell in the land after he hath
 been commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also
 perish. Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the
 land.
 
 And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these
 records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of
 our fathers;
 
 And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have
 been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have
 been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since
 the world began, even down unto this present time.
 
 And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I
 persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the
 commandments of God.
 
 And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our
 inheritance, and we did gather together our gold, and our silver,
 and our precious things.
 
 And after we had gathered these things together, we went up
 again unto the house of Laban.
 
 And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired
 him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven
 upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our
 gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.
 
 And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and
 that it was exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch
 that he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he
 might obtain our property.
 
 And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of
 Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it
 fell into the hands of Laban.
 
 And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the
 servants of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in
 the cavity of a rock.
 
 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also
 with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the
 words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard
 words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even
 with a rod.
 
 And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an
 angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto
 them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod?
 Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you,
 and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to
 Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.
 
 And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.
 
 And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again
 began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will
 deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he
 can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?
 
 
 And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let
 us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping
 the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all
 the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea,
 or even than his tens of thousands?
 
 Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for
 he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided
 hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of
 captivity, on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow
 and were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.
 
 Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an
 angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go
 up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to
 destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.
 
 Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and
 did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up
 until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.
 
 And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide
 themselves without the walls. And after they had hid themselves,
 I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of
 Laban.
 
 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things
 which I should do.
 
 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house
 of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before
 me, for he was drunken with wine.
 
 And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.
 
 And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath
 thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the
 workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the
 blade thereof was of the most precious steel.
 
 And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that
 I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time
 have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I
 might not slay him.
 
 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath
 delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had
 sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken
 unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our
 property.
 
 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay
 him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;
 
 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his
 righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than
 that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.
 
 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered
 the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness,
 saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments,
 they shall prosper in the land of promise.
 
 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the
 commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they
 should have the law.
 
 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of
 brass.
 
 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my
 hands for this cause--that I might obtain the records according
 to his commandments.
 
 Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban
 by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own
 sword.
 
 And after I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I
 took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea,
 even every whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.
 
 And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of
 Laban. And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban,
 behold, I saw the servant of Laban who had the keys of the
 treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he
 should go with me into the treasury.
 
 And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the
 garments and also the sword girded about my loins.
 
 And he spake unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he
 knowing that his master, Laban, had been out by night among them.
 
 And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban.
 
 And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings,
 which were upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, who
 were without the walls.
 
 And I also bade him that he should follow me.
 
 And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church,
 and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he
 did follow me.
 
 And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the
 Jews, as I went forth unto my brethren, who were without the
 walls.
 
 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly
 frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before
 my presence; for they supposed it was Laban, and that he had
 slain me and had sought to take away their lives also.
 
 And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did
 hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.
 
 And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my
 brethren he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before
 me and return to the city of Jerusalem.
 
 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also
 having received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize
 upon the servant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.
 
 And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would
 hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so
 that if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his life.
 
 And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not
 fear; that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go
 down in the wilderness with us.
 
 And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath
 commanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in
 keeping the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go
 down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with
 us.
 
 And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words
 which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he
 promised that he would go down into the wilderness unto our
 father. Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would
 tarry with us from that time forth.
 
 Now we were desirous that he should tarry with us for this
 cause, that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into
 the wilderness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.
 
 And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto us,
 our fears did cease concerning him.
 
 And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the
 servant of Laban, and departed into the wilderness, and journeyed
 unto the tent of our father.
 
 
 And it came to pass that after we had come down into the
 wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and
 also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had
 mourned because of us.
 
 For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness;
 and she also had complained against my father, telling him that
 he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth
 from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we
 perish in the wilderness.
 
 And after this manner of language had my mother complained
 against my father.
 
 And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying:
 I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the
 things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of
 God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my
 brethren.
 
 But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which
 things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver
 my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto
 us in the wilderness.
 
 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort
 my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the
 wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of
 the Jews.
 
 And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold
 their joy was full, and my mother was comforted.
 
 And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord
 hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I
 also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and
 delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power
 whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath
 commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak.
 
 And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did
 offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave
 thanks unto the God of Israel.
 
 And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my
 father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the
 plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.
 
 And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses,
 which gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of
 Adam and Eve, who were our first parents;
 
 And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down
 to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;
 
 And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the
 beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of
 Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the
 mouth of Jeremiah.
 
 And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the
 plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew
 that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was
 the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved
 by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father,
 Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.
 
 And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land
 of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.
 
 And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his
 fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he
 and his fathers had kept the records.
 
 And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled
 with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed--
 
 That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations,
 kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.
 
 Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never
 perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he
 prophesied many things concerning his seed.
 
 And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept
 the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.
 
 And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded
 us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea,
 even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the
 commandments of the Lord unto our children.
 
 Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry
 them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land
 of promise.
 
 
 And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in
 this part of my record; neither at any time shall I give it after
 upon these plates which I am writing; for it is given in the
 record which has been kept by my father; wherefore, I do not
 write it in this work.
 
 For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.
 
 And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full
 account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be
 written upon these plates, for I desire the room that I may write
 of the things of God.
 
 For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to
 come unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
 of Jacob, and be saved.
 
 Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do
 not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto
 those who are not of the world.
 
 Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they
 shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth
 unto the children of men.
 
 
 And now I would that ye might know, that after my father,
 Lehi, had made an end of prophesying concerning his seed, it came
 to pass that the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was
 not meet for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the
 wilderness alone; but that his sons should take daughters to
 wife, that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of
 promise.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi,
 and my brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem,
 and bring down Ishmael and his family into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again, with my
 brethren, go forth into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem.
 
 And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael,
 and we did gain favor in the sight of Ishmael, insomuch that we
 did speak unto him the words of the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of
 Ishmael, and also his household, insomuch that they took their
 journey with us down into the wilderness to the tent of our
 father.
 
 And it came to pass that as we journeyed in the wilderness,
 behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and
 the two sons of Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us;
 yea, against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father, Ishmael, and
 his wife, and his three other daughters.
 
 And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they were desirous
 to return unto the land of Jerusalem.
 
 And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness of their
 hearts, therefore I spake unto them, saying, yea, even unto Laman
 and unto Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it
 that ye are so hard in your hearts, and so blind in your minds,
 that ye have need that I, your younger brother, should speak unto
 you, yea, and set an example for you?
 
 How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the
 Lord?
 
 How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel
 of the Lord?
 
 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten what great things
 the Lord hath done for us, in delivering us out of the hands of
 Laban, and also that we should obtain the record?
 
 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is
 able to do all things according to his will, for the children of
 men, if it so be that they exercise faith in him? Wherefore, let
 us be faithful to him.
 
 And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain
 the land of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that
 the word of the Lord shall be fulfilled concerning the
 destruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath
 spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.
 
 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive
 with them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and
 Jeremiah have they cast into prison. And they have sought to
 take away the life of my father, insomuch that they have driven
 him out of the land.
 
 Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto
 Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them. And now, if ye have
 choice, go up to the land, and remember the words which I speak
 unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit
 of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.
 
 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these
 words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to
 pass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were
 exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they
 sought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the
 wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts.
 
 But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O
 Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver
 me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that
 I may burst these bands with which I am bound.
 
 And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold,
 the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood
 before my brethren, and I spake unto them again.
 
 And it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and
 sought to lay hands upon me; but behold, one of the daughters of
 Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of
 Ishmael, did plead with my brethren, insomuch that they did
 soften their hearts; and they did cease striving to take away my
 life.
 
 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of
 their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and
 did plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that
 they had done against me.
 
 And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that
 they had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto
 the Lord their God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that
 they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we
 did again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.
 
 And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of
 our father. And after I and my brethren and all the house of
 Ishmael had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give
 thanks unto the Lord their God; and they did offer sacrifice and
 burnt offerings unto him.
 
 
 And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner
 of seeds of every kind, both of grain of every kind, and also of
 the seeds of fruit of every kind.
 
 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the
 wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have dreamed a
 dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision.
 
 And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have
 reason to rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi and also of Sam;
 for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their
 seed, will be saved.
 
 But behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of
 you; for behold, methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary
 wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a
 white robe; and he came and stood before me.
 
 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow
 him.
 
 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself
 that I was in a dark and dreary waste.
 
 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in
 darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy
 on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.
 
 And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld
 a large and spacious field.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was
 desirable to make one happy.
 
 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the
 fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all
 that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit
 thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever
 seen.
 
 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with
 exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my
 family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was
 desirable above all other fruit.
 
 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might
 discover my family also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran
 along, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the
 fruit.
 
 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the
 head thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof I beheld
 your mother Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they
 knew not whither they should go.
 
 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did
 say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me,
 and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other
 fruit.
 
 And it came to pass that they did come unto me and partake of
 the fruit also.
 
 And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel
 should come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine
 eyes towards the head of the river, that perhaps I might see
 them.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would not come
 unto me and partake of the fruit.
 
 And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of
 the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.
 
 And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along
 by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it
 also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious
 field, as if it had been a world.
 
 And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were
 pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto
 the tree by which I stood.
 
 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in
 the path which led to the tree.
 
 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea,
 even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they
 who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they
 wandered off and were lost.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward,
 and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of
 iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness,
 clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and
 partake of the fruit of the tree.
 
 And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did
 cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed.
 
 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other
 side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it
 stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.
 
 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male
 and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and
 they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers
 towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.
 
 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed,
 because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away
 into forbidden paths and were lost.
 
 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.
 
 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes
 pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the
 rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually
 holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell
 down and partook of the fruit of the tree.
 
 And he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards
 that great and spacious building.
 
 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of
 the fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in
 strange roads.
 
 And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange
 building. And after they did enter into that building they did
 point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of
 the fruit also; but we heeded them not.
 
 These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them,
 had fallen away.
 
 And Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, said my
 father.
 
 And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words
 of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because
 of these things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared
 for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off
 from the presence of the Lord.
 
 And he did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender
 parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the
 Lord would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my
 father did preach unto them.
 
 And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto
 them of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the
 Lord; and he did cease speaking unto them.
 
 
 And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak,
 as he dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel, and also a great
 many more things, which cannot be written upon these plates.
 
 And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they
 are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the
 history of my people; for the plates upon which I make a full
 account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore,
 they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and
 these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.
 
 Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I
 should make these plates, for the special purpose that there
 should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people.
 
 Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the
 reign of the kings, and the wars and contentions of my people;
 wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry; and
 the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings
 and the wars and contentions of my people.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for
 a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not.
 
 But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore,
 he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children
 of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all
 his words. And thus it is. Amen.
 
 
 And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates
 of my proceedings, and my reign and ministry; wherefore, to
 proceed with mine account, I must speak somewhat of the things of
 my father, and also of my brethren.
 
 For behold, it came to pass after my father had made an end of
 speaking the words of his dream, and also of exhorting them to
 all diligence, he spake unto them concerning the Jews--
 
 That after they should be destroyed, even that great city
 Jerusalem, and many be carried away captive into Babylon,
 according to the own due time of the Lord, they should return
 again, yea, even be brought back out of captivity; and after they
 should be brought back out of captivity they should possess again
 the land of their inheritance.
 
 Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left
 Jerusalem, a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the
 Jews--even a Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world.
 
 And he also spake concerning the prophets, how great a number
 had testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of whom
 he had spoken, or this Redeemer of the world.
 
 Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state,
 and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer.
 
 And he spake also concerning a prophet who should come before
 the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord--
 
 Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness:
 Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for
 there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier
 than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And
 much spake my father concerning this thing.
 
 And my father said he should baptize in Bethabara, beyond
 Jordan; and he also said he should baptize with water; even that
 he should baptize the Messiah with water.
 
 And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should
 behold and bear record that he had baptized the Lamb of God, who
 should take away the sins of the world.
 
 And it came to pass after my father had spoken these words he
 spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be
 preached among the Jews, and also concerning the dwindling of the
 Jews in unbelief. And after they had slain the Messiah, who
 should come, and after he had been slain he should rise from the
 dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto
 the Gentiles.
 
 Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and
 also concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared
 like unto an olive-tree, whose branches should be broken off and
 should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.
 
 Wherefore, he said it must needs be that we should be led
 with one accord into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of
 the word of the Lord, that we should be scattered upon all the
 face of the earth.
 
 And after the house of Israel should be scattered they should
 be gathered together again; or, in fine, after the Gentiles had
 received the fulness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the
 olive-tree, or the remnants of the house of Israel, should be
 grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their
 Lord and their Redeemer.
 
 And after this manner of language did my father prophesy and
 speak unto my brethren, and also many more things which I do not
 write in this book; for I have written as many of them as were
 expedient for me in mine other book.
 
 And all these things, of which I have spoken, were done as my
 father dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel.
 
 And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the
 words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a
 vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the
 Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of
 God--and the Son of God was the Messiah who should come--I,
 Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of
 these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift
 of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times
 of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the
 children of men.
 
 For he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the
 way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if
 it so be that they repent and come unto him.
 
 For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries
 of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy
 Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in
 times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the
 Lord is one eternal round.
 
 Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be
 brought into judgment.
 
 Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of
 your probation, then ye are found unclean before the
 judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God;
 wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.
 
 And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak these
 things, and deny them not.
 
 
 For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things
 that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to
 make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was
 caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly
 high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I
 never had before set my foot.
 
 And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?
 
 And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.
 
 And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father
 saw the tree of which he hath spoken?
 
 And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of
 my father.
 
 And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a
 loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for
 he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed
 art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most
 high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast
 desired.
 
 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign,
 that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which
 thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of
 heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him
 ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.
 
 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look! And I
 looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my
 father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea,
 exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the
 whiteness of the driven snow.
 
 And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the
 Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is
 precious above all.
 
 And he said unto me: What desirest thou?
 
 And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof--for
 I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in
 the form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the
 Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with
 another.
 
 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look! And I looked
 as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from
 before my presence.
 
 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city
 of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of
 Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she
 was exceedingly fair and white.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel
 came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what
 beholdest thou?
 
 And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above
 all other virgins.
 
 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?
 
 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children;
 nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.
 
 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is
 the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away
 in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit
 for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!
 
 And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in
 her arms.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even
 the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the
 tree which thy father saw?
 
 And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which
 sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men;
 wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.
 
 And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the
 soul.
 
 And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look!
 And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the
 children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship
 him.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which
 my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the
 fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters
 are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that
 the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.
 
 And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the
 condescension of God!
 
 And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my
 father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should
 prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and
 was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the
 heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and
 abide upon him in the form of a dove.
 
 And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people,
 in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered
 together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from
 among them.
 
 And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came
 to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my
 face, and I saw them not.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again,
 saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again,
 and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they
 did minister unto them.
 
 And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and
 I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men.
 And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were
 afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and
 unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things
 unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God;
 and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again,
 saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he
 was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was
 judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.
 
 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and
 slain for the sins of the world.
 
 And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth,
 that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of
 the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the
 Lord.
 
 And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I
 beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto
 the building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord
 spake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom
 thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together
 to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the
 great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it
 fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel
 of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the
 destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that
 shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Look, and
 behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren. And I looked
 and beheld the land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of
 people, yea, even as it were in number as many as the sand of the
 sea.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld multitudes gathered together
 to battle, one against the other; and I beheld wars, and rumors
 of wars, and great slaughters with the sword among my people.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld many generations pass away,
 after the manner of wars and contentions in the land; and I
 beheld many cities, yea, even that I did not number them.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw a mist of darkness on the face
 of the land of promise; and I saw lightnings, and I heard
 thunderings, and earthquakes, and all manner of tumultuous
 noises; and I saw the earth and the rocks, that they rent; and I
 saw mountains tumbling into pieces; and I saw the plains of the
 earth, that they were broken up; and I saw many cities that they
 were sunk; and I saw many that they were burned with fire; and I
 saw many that did tumble to the earth, because of the quaking
 thereof.
 
 And it came to pass after I saw these things, I saw the vapor
 of darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and
 behold, I saw multitudes who had not fallen because of the great
 and terrible judgments of the Lord.
 
 And I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out
 of heaven; and he came down and showed himself unto them.
 
 And I also saw and bear record that the Holy Ghost fell upon
 twelve others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen.
 
 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the twelve
 disciples of the Lamb, who are chosen to minister unto thy seed.
 
 And he said unto me: Thou rememberest the twelve apostles of
 the Lamb? Behold they are they who shall judge the twelve tribes
 of Israel; wherefore, the twelve ministers of thy seed shall be
 judged of them; for ye are of the house of Israel.
 
 And these twelve ministers whom thou beholdest shall judge
 thy seed. And, behold, they are righteous forever; for because
 of their faith in the Lamb of God their garments are made white
 in his blood.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Look! And I looked, and beheld
 three generations pass away in righteousness; and their garments
 were white even like unto the Lamb of God. And the angel said
 unto me: These are made white in the blood of the Lamb, because
 of their faith in him.
 
 And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth generation who
 passed away in righteousness.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw the multitudes of the earth
 gathered together.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold thy seed, and also the
 seed of thy brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the people of my
 seed gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my
 brethren; and they were gathered together to battle.
 
 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the fountain of
 filthy water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of which
 he spake; and the depths thereof are the depths of hell.
 
 And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil,
 which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children
 of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish
 and are lost.
 
 And the large and spacious building, which thy father saw, is
 vain imaginations and the pride of the children of men. And a
 great and a terrible gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of
 the justice of the Eternal God, and the Messiah who is the Lamb
 of God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record, from the beginning
 of the world until this time, and from this time henceforth and
 forever.
 
 And while the angel spake these words, I beheld and saw that
 the seed of my brethren did contend against my seed, according to
 the word of the angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and
 the temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my
 brethren did overpower the people of my seed.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld, and saw the people of the
 seed of my brethren that they had overcome my seed; and they went
 forth in multitudes upon the face of the land.
 
 And I saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw
 wars and rumors of wars among them; and in wars and rumors of
 wars I saw many generations pass away.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold these shall dwindle in
 unbelief.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld, after they had dwindled in
 unbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people,
 full of idleness and all manner of abominations.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying:
 Look! And I looked and beheld many nations and kingdoms.
 
 And the angel said unto me: What beholdest thou? And I said:
 I behold many nations and kingdoms.
 
 And he said unto me: These are the nations and kingdoms of the
 Gentiles.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the
 Gentiles the formation of a great church.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold the formation of a church
 which is most abominable above all other churches, which slayeth
 the saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down,
 and yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into
 captivity.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable
 church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it.
 
 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and
 fine-twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw
 many harlots.
 
 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the
 silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine-twined
 linen, and the precious clothing, and the harlots, are the
 desires of this great and abominable church.
 
 And also for the praise of the world do they destroy the
 saints of God, and bring them down into captivity.
 
 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld many waters; and
 they divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Behold the
 wrath of God is upon the seed of thy brethren.
 
 And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was
 separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I
 beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the
 man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed
 of my brethren, who were in the promised land.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it
 wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of
 captivity, upon the many waters.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the
 Gentiles upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God,
 that it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered
 before the Gentiles and were smitten.
 
 And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the
 Gentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their
 inheritance; and I beheld that they were white, and exceedingly
 fair and beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles
 who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before
 the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them.
 
 And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered
 together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle
 against them.
 
 And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also
 that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered
 together against them to battle.
 
 And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of
 captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of
 all other nations.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did
 prosper in the land; and I beheld a book, and it was carried
 forth among them.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Knowest thou the meaning of the
 book?
 
 And I said unto him: I know not.
 
 And he said: Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew.
 And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he said unto me: The book that thou
 beholdest is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants
 of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel; and it
 also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy prophets; and
 it is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the plates
 of brass, save there are not so many; nevertheless, they contain
 the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of
 Israel; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the Gentiles.
 
 And the angel of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast beheld that
 the book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it
 proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew it contained the fulness
 of the gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve apostles bear
 record; and they bear record according to the truth which is in
 the Lamb of God.
 
 Wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews in purity unto
 the Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God.
 
 And after they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of
 the Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the
 formation of a great and abominable church, which is most
 abominable above all other churches; for behold, they have taken
 away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and
 most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they
 taken away.
 
 And all this have they done that they might pervert the right
 ways of the Lord, that they might blind the eyes and harden the
 hearts of the children of men.
 
 Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth
 through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there
 are many plain and precious things taken away from the book,
 which is the book of the Lamb of God.
 
 And after these plain and precious things were taken away it
 goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and after it
 goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles, yea, even
 across the many waters which thou hast seen with the Gentiles
 which have gone forth out of captivity, thou seest--because of
 the many plain and precious things which have been taken out of
 the book, which were plain unto the understanding of the children
 of men, according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of
 God--because of these things which are taken away out of the
 gospel of the Lamb, an exceedingly great many do stumble, yea,
 insomuch that Satan hath great power over them.
 
 Nevertheless, thou beholdest that the Gentiles who have gone
 forth out of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of
 God above all other nations, upon the face of the land which is
 choice above all other lands, which is the land that the Lord God
 hath covenanted with thy father that his seed should have for the
 land of their inheritance; wherefore, thou seest that the Lord
 God will not suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the
 mixture of thy seed, which are among thy brethren.
 
 Neither will he suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy the
 seed of thy brethren.
 
 Neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall
 forever remain in that awful state of blindness, which thou
 beholdest they are in, because of the plain and most precious
 parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that
 abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen.
 
 Wherefore saith the Lamb of God: I will be merciful unto the
 Gentiles, unto the visiting of the remnant of the house of Israel
 in great judgment.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me,
 saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after I have visited the
 remnant of the house of Israel--and this remnant of whom I speak
 is the seed of thy father--wherefore, after I have visited them
 in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and
 after the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most
 plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have
 been kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of
 harlots, saith the Lamb--I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in
 that day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in mine own
 power, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious,
 saith the Lamb.
 
 For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy
 seed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister
 unto them, which shall be plain and precious; and after thy seed
 shall be destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of
 thy brethren, behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth
 unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb.
 
 And in them shall be written my gospel, saith the Lamb, and
 my rock and my salvation.
 
 And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at
 that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy
 Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at
 the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of
 the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great
 joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of
 my brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had
 proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew, that it came forth
 from the Gentiles unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren.
 
 And after it had come forth unto them I beheld other books,
 which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto
 them, unto the convincing of the Gentiles and the remnant of the
 seed of my brethren, and also the Jews who were scattered upon
 all the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and
 of the twelve apostles of the Lamb are true.
 
 And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records,
 which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the
 truth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb,
 and shall make known the plain and precious things which have
 been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds,
 tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the
 Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men
 must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.
 
 And they must come according to the words which shall be
 established by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb
 shall be made known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the
 records of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore they both
 shall be established in one; for there is one God and one
 Shepherd over all the earth.
 
 And the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all
 nations, both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles; and after
 he has manifested himself unto the Jews and also unto the
 Gentiles, then he shall manifest himself unto the Gentiles and
 also unto the Jews, and the last shall be first, and the first
 shall be last.
 
 
 And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken
 unto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself
 unto them in word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the
 taking away of their stumbling blocks--
 
 And harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God, they
 shall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, they shall
 be numbered among the house of Israel; and they shall be a
 blessed people upon the promised land forever; they shall be no
 more brought down into captivity; and the house of Israel shall
 no more be confounded.
 
 And that great pit, which hath been digged for them by that
 great and abominable church, which was founded by the devil and
 his children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to
 hell--yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the
 destruction of men shall be filled by those who digged it, unto
 their utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the
 destruction of the soul, save it be the casting of it into that
 hell which hath no end.
 
 For behold, this is according to the captivity of the devil,
 and also according to the justice of God, upon all those who will
 work wickedness and abomination before him.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi,
 saying: Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent it shall be
 well with them; and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of
 the Lord unto the house of Israel; and thou also hast heard that
 whoso repenteth not must perish.
 
 Therefore, wo be unto the Gentiles if it so be that they
 harden their hearts against the Lamb of God.
 
 For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a
 great and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work
 which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the
 other--either to the convincing of them unto peace and life
 eternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their
 hearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought
 down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally
 and spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of
 which I have spoken.
 
 And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these
 words, he said unto me: Rememberest thou the covenants of the
 Father unto the house of Israel? I said unto him, Yea.
 
 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look, and behold
 that great and abominable church, which is the mother of
 abominations, whose founder is the devil.
 
 And he said unto me: Behold there are save two churches only;
 the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the
 church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church
 of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the
 mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.
 
 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all
 the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion
 over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and
 people.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of
 God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and
 abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless,
 I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God,
 were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions
 upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness
 of the great whore whom I saw.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of
 abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all
 the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight
 against the Lamb of God.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the
 Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of
 the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were
 scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed
 with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was
 poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that
 there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and
 kindreds of the earth.
 
 And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all
 the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the
 angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the
 mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things--
 
 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out
 upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable
 church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at
 that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the
 way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to
 his people who are of the house of Israel.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying:
 Look!
 
 And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white
 robe.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold one of the twelve apostles
 of the Lamb.
 
 Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of these things;
 yea, and also many things which have been.
 
 And he shall also write concerning the end of the world.
 
 Wherefore, the things which he shall write are just and true;
 and behold they are written in the book which thou beheld
 proceeding out of the mouth of the Jew; and at the time they
 proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book
 proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were
 written were plain and pure, and most precious and easy to the
 understanding of all men.
 
 And behold, the things which this apostle of the Lamb shall
 write are many things which thou hast seen; and behold, the
 remainder shalt thou see.
 
 But the things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not
 write; for the Lord God hath ordained the apostle of the Lamb of
 God that he should write them.
 
 And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all
 things, and they have written them; and they are sealed up to
 come forth in their purity, according to the truth which is in
 the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of
 Israel.
 
 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the
 apostle of the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel.
 
 And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the
 remainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the
 things which I have written sufficeth me; and I have written but
 a small part of the things which I saw.
 
 And I bear record that I saw the things which my father saw,
 and the angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.
 
 And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which
 I saw while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the
 things which I saw are not written, the things which I have
 written are true. And thus it is. Amen.
 
 
 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away
 in the spirit, and seen all these things, I returned to the tent
 of my father.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren, and they were
 disputing one with another concerning the things my father had
 spoken unto them.
 
 For he truly spake many great things unto them, which were
 hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and
 they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto
 the Lord as they ought.
 
 And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the hardness of their
 hearts, and also, because of the things which I had seen, and
 knew they must unavoidably come to pass because of the great
 wickedness of the children of men.
 
 And it came to pass that I was overcome because of my
 afflictions, for I considered that mine afflictions were great
 above all, because of the destruction of my people, for I had
 beheld their fall.
 
 And it came to pass that after I had received strength I spake
 unto my brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their
 disputations.
 
 And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words which
 our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the
 olive-tree, and also concerning the Gentiles.
 
 And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?
 
 And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord maketh no
 such thing known unto us.
 
 Behold, I said unto them: How is it that ye do not keep the
 commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because
 of the hardness of your hearts?
 
 Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--If
 ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing
 that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments,
 surely these things shall be made known unto you.
 
 Behold, I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared
 unto an olive-tree, by the Spirit of the Lord which was in our
 father; and behold are we not broken off from the house of
 Israel, and are we not a branch of the house of Israel?
 
 And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the
 grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the
 Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have
 dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many
 generations after the Messiah shall be manifested in body unto
 the children of men, then shall the fulness of the gospel of the
 Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the
 remnant of our seed--
 
 And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they
 are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people
 of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge
 of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of
 their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him;
 wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and
 the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come
 unto him and be saved.
 
 And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise
 unto their everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea,
 at that day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment
 from the true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of
 God?
 
 Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again
 among the house of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a
 natural branch of the olive-tree, into the true olive-tree.
 
 And this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it
 will not come to pass until after they are scattered by the
 Gentiles; and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the
 Gentiles, that the Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for
 the very cause that he shall be rejected of the Jews, or of the
 house of Israel.
 
 Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but
 also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which
 should be fulfilled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord
 made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the
 kindreds of the earth be blessed.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them
 concerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the
 restoration of the Jews in the latter days.
 
 And I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, who spake
 concerning the restoration of the Jews, or of the house of
 Israel; and after they were restored they should no more be
 confounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came
 to pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they
 were pacified and did humble themselves before the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that they did speak unto me again,
 saying: What meaneth this thing which our father saw in a dream?
 What meaneth the tree which he saw?
 
 And I said unto them: It was a representation of the tree of
 life.
 
 And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of iron which our
 father saw, that led to the tree?
 
 And I said unto them that it was the word of God, and whose
 would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it,
 they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the
 fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to
 lead them away to destruction.
 
 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the
 word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of
 my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they
 would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his
 commandments always in all things.
 
 And they said unto me: What meaneth the river of water which
 our father saw?
 
 And I said unto them that the water which my father saw was
 filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things
 that he beheld not the filthiness of the water.
 
 And I said unto them that it was an awful gulf, which
 separated the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the
 saints of God.
 
 And I said unto them that it was a representation of that
 awful hell, which the angel said unto me was prepared for the
 wicked.
 
 And I said unto them that our father also saw that the
 justice of God did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and
 the brightness thereof was like unto the brightness of a flaming
 fire, which ascendeth up unto God forever and ever, and hath no
 end.
 
 And they said unto me: Doth this thing mean the torment of
 the body in the days of probation, or doth it mean the final
 state of the soul after the death of the temporal body, or doth
 it speak of the things which are temporal?
 
 And it came to pass that I said unto them that it was a
 representation of things both temporal and spiritual; for the day
 should come that they must be judged of their works, yea, even
 the works which were done by the temporal body in their days of
 probation.
 
 Wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness they must
 be cast off also, as to the things which are spiritual, which are
 pertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to
 stand before God, to be judged of their works; and if their works
 have been filthiness they must needs be filthy; and if they be
 filthy it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of
 God; if so, the kingdom of God must be filthy also.
 
 But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy,
 and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God;
 wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for
 that which is filthy.
 
 And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful hell of
 which I have spoken, and the devil is the preparator of it;
 wherefore the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the
 kingdom of God, or to be cast out because of that justice of
 which I have spoken.
 
 Wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the righteous, and
 also from that tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and
 most desirable above all other fruits; yea, and it is the
 greatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I spake unto my
 brethren. Amen.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end
 of speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast
 declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.
 
 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I
 had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the
 truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that
 they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty
 taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very
 center.
 
 And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to
 hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk
 uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the
 truth, and say: Thou speakest hard things against us.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my brethren,
 with all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the
 Lord; insomuch that I had joy and great hopes of them, that they
 would walk in the paths of righteousness.
 
 Now, all these things were said and done as my father dwelt in
 a tent in the valley which he called Lemuel.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daughters
 of Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the daughters
 of Ishmael to wife; and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of
 Ishmael to wife.
 
 And thus my father had fulfilled all the commandments of the
 Lord which had been given unto him. And also, I, Nephi, had been
 blessed of the Lord exceedingly.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord spake unto my
 father by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he should
 take his journey into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning,
 and went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he
 beheld upon the ground a round ball of curious workmanship; and
 it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and
 the one pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever
 things we should carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder
 of our provisions which the Lord had given unto us; and we did
 take seed of every kind that we might carry into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that we did take our tents and depart
 into the wilderness, across the river Laman.
 
 And it came to pass that we traveled for the space of four
 days, nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our
 tents again; and we did call the name of the place Shazer.
 
 And it came to pass that we did take our bows and our arrows,
 and go forth into the wilderness to slay food for our families;
 and after we had slain food for our families we did return again
 to our families in the wilderness, to the place of Shazer. And
 we did go forth again in the wilderness, following the same
 direction, keeping in the most fertile parts of the wilderness,
 which were in the borders near the Red Sea.
 
 And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many
 days, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and
 our stones and our slings.
 
 And we did follow the directions of the ball, which led us in
 the more fertile parts of the wilderness.
 
 And after we had traveled for the space of many days, we did
 pitch our tents for the space of a time, that we might again rest
 ourselves and obtain food for our families.
 
 And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay
 food, behold, I did break my bow, which was made of fine steel;
 and after I did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with
 me because of the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food.
 
 And it came to pass that we did return without food to our
 families, and being much fatigued, because of their journeying,
 they did suffer much for the want of food.
 
 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of
 Ishmael did begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their
 sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness; and also my father
 began to murmur against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all
 exceedingly sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the
 Lord.
 
 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, having been afflicted with
 my brethren because of the loss of my bow, and their bows having
 lost their springs, it began to be exceedingly difficult, yea,
 insomuch that we could obtain no food.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak much unto my
 brethren, because they had hardened their hearts again, even unto
 complaining against the Lord their God.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a
 bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm
 myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones.
 And I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?
 
 And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they
 had humbled themselves because of my words; for I did say many
 things unto them in the energy of my soul.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
 father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring
 against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the
 depths of sorrow.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him:
 Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written.
 
 And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things
 which were written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble
 exceedingly, and also my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and our
 wives.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which
 were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and
 diligence and heed which we did give unto them.
 
 And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was
 plain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the
 ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to
 time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it.
 
 And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about
 great things.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the
 top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given
 upon the ball.
 
 And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, insomuch
 that I did obtain food for our families.
 
 And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing
 the beasts which I had slain; and now when they beheld that I had
 obtained food, how great was their joy! And it came to pass that
 they did humble themselves before the Lord, and did give thanks
 unto him.
 
 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey,
 traveling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after
 we had traveled for the space of many days we did pitch our tents
 again, that we might tarry for the space of a time.
 
 And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the
 place which was called Nahom.
 
 And it came to pass that the daughters of Ishmael did mourn
 exceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because of
 their afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against
 my father, because he had brought them out of the land of
 Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and we have wandered
 much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction,
 hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings we
 must perish in the wilderness with hunger.
 
 And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against
 me; and they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem.
 
 And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael:
 Behold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who
 has taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are
 his elder brethren.
 
 Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that
 angels have ministered unto him. But behold, we know that he
 lies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many
 things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes,
 thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange
 wilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make
 himself a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us
 according to his will and pleasure. And after this manner did my
 brother Laman stir up their hearts to anger.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the
 voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and
 did chasten them exceedingly; and after they were chastened by
 the voice of the Lord they did turn away their anger, and did
 repent of their sins, insomuch that the Lord did bless us again
 with food, that we did not perish.
 
 
 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the
 wilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward from that time
 forth. And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the
 wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness.
 
 And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that
 while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did
 give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea,
 even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings
 without murmurings.
 
 And thus we see that the commandments of God must be
 fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the
 commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them,
 and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he
 has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while
 we did sojourn in the wilderness.
 
 And we did sojourn for the space of many years, yea, even
 eight years in the wilderness.
 
 And we did come to the land which we called Bountiful, because
 of its much fruit and also wild honey; and all these things were
 prepared of the Lord that we might not perish. And we beheld the
 sea, which we called Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is many
 waters.
 
 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the
 seashore; and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions
 and much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them
 all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the seashore;
 and we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit.
 
 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land
 of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord
 came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And
 it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and
 cried unto the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou
 shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee,
 that I may carry thy people across these waters.
 
 And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to
 molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the
 manner which thou hast shown unto me?
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go
 to find ore, that I might make tools.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows
 wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I
 had made a bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire,
 I did smite two stones together that I might make fire.
 
 For the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make
 much fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he said: I will
 make thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not;
 
 And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will
 prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my
 commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my
 commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye
 shall know that it is by me that ye are led.
 
 Yea, and the Lord said also that: After ye have arrived in
 the promised land, ye shall know that I, the Lord, am God; and
 that I, the Lord, did deliver you from destruction; yea, that I
 did bring you out of the land of Jerusalem.
 
 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the commandments of
 the Lord, and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and
 diligence.
 
 And it came to pass that I did make tools of the ore which I
 did molten out of the rock.
 
 And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship,
 they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool,
 for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also
 thinketh that he can cross these great waters.
 
 And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were
 desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that
 I could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was
 instructed of the Lord.
 
 And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was exceedingly
 sorrowful because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when
 they saw that I began to be sorrowful they were glad in their
 hearts, insomuch that they did rejoice over me, saying: We knew
 that ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that ye were
 lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so
 great a work.
 
 And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish
 imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of
 Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for these many
 years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they
 have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things,
 save it were death; and it would have been better that they had
 died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered
 these afflictions.
 
 Behold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness,
 which time we might have enjoyed our possessions and the land of
 our inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy.
 
 And we know that the people who were in the land of Jerusalem
 were a righteous people; for they kept the statutes and judgments
 of the Lord, and all his commandments, according to the law of
 Moses; wherefore, we know that they are a righteous people; and
 our father hath judged them, and hath led us away because we
 would hearken unto his words; yea, and our brother is like unto
 him. And after this manner of language did my brethren murmur
 and complain against us.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying:
 Do ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel,
 would have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if
 they had not hearkened unto the words of the Lord?
 
 Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of
 bondage, if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead
 them out of bondage?
 
 Now ye know that the children of Israel were in bondage; and
 ye know that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to
 be borne; wherefore, ye know that it must needs be a good thing
 for them, that they should be brought out of bondage.
 
 Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that
 great work; and ye know that by his word the waters of the Red
 Sea were divided hither and thither, and they passed through on
 dry ground.
 
 But ye know that the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea,
 who were the armies of Pharaoh.
 
 And ye also know that they were fed with manna in the
 wilderness.
 
 Yea, and ye also know that Moses, by his word according to
 the power of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came
 forth water, that the children of Israel might quench their
 thirst.
 
 And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their
 Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day and giving light
 unto them by night, and doing all things for them which were
 expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and
 blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the
 true and living God.
 
 And it came to pass that according to his word he did destroy
 them; and according to his word he did lead them; and according
 to his word he did do all things for them; and there was not any
 thing done save it were by his word.
 
 And after they had crossed the river Jordan he did make them
 mighty unto the driving out of the children of the land, yea,
 unto the scattering them to destruction.
 
 And now, do ye suppose that the children of this land, who
 were in the land of promise, who were driven out by our fathers,
 do ye suppose that they were righteous? Behold, I say unto you,
 Nay.
 
 Do ye suppose that our fathers would have been more choice
 than they if they had been righteous? I say unto you, Nay.
 
 Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is
 righteous is favored of God. But behold, this people had
 rejected every word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and
 the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did
 curse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea,
 he did curse it against them unto their destruction, and he did
 bless it unto our fathers unto their obtaining power over it.
 
 Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be
 inhabited; and he hath created his children that they should
 possess it.
 
 And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the
 nations of the wicked.
 
 And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and
 the wicked he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for
 their sakes.
 
 He ruleth high in the heavens, for it is his throne, and this
 earth is his footstool.
 
 And he loveth those who will have him to be their God.
 Behold, he loved our fathers, and he covenanted with them, yea,
 even Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants
 which he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land
 of Egypt.
 
 And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod; for
 they hardened their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord
 straitened them because of their iniquity. He sent fiery flying
 serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way
 that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to
 perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or
 the easiness of it, there were many who perished.
 
 And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they
 did revile against Moses, and also against God; nevertheless, ye
 know that they were led forth by his matchless power into the
 land of promise.
 
 And now, after all these things, the time has come that they
 have become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but
 they are at this day about to be destroyed; for I know that the
 day must surely come that they must be destroyed, save a few
 only, who shall be led away into captivity.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he should depart
 into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his
 life; yea, and ye also have sought to take away his life;
 wherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts and ye are like unto
 them.
 
 Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord
 your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye
 have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto
 you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye
 could not feel his words; wherefore, he has spoken unto you like
 unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as
 if it were to divide asunder.
 
 And ye also know that by the power of his almighty word he
 can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know
 that by his word he can cause the rough places to be made smooth,
 and smooth places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, that
 ye can be so hard in your hearts?
 
 Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of you, and my
 heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall be cast off forever.
 Behold, I am full of the Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame
 has no strength.
 
 And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words,
 they were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the
 depths of the sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon
 me I spake unto them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I
 command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power
 of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay
 his hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall
 be as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto them that they
 should murmur no more against their father; neither should they
 withhold their labor from me, for God had commanded me that I
 should build a ship.
 
 And I said unto them: If God had commanded me to do all
 things I could do them. If he should command me that I should
 say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I
 should say it, it would be done.
 
 And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so
 many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot
 instruct me, that I should build a ship?
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my
 brethren, insomuch that they were confounded and could not
 contend against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon me
 nor touch me with their fingers, even for the space of many days.
 
 Now they durst not do this lest they should wither before me, so
 powerful was the Spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon
 them.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth
 thine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither
 before thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord, and this will
 I do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God.
 
 And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my
 brethren, and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did
 shake them, even according to the word which he had spoken.
 
 And now, they said: We know of a surety that the Lord is with
 thee, for we know that it is the power of the Lord that has
 shaken us. And they fell down before me, and were about to
 worship me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy
 brother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the
 Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days
 may be long in the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.
 
 
 And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go
 forth with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship.
 And the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I
 should work the timbers of the ship.
 
 Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which
 was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner
 of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had
 shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men.
 
 And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft
 unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things.
 
 And it came to pass that after I had finished the ship,
 according to the word of the Lord, my brethren beheld that it was
 good, and that the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine;
 wherefore, they did humble themselves again before the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
 father, that we should arise and go down into the ship.
 
 And it came to pass that on the morrow, after we had prepared
 all things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey
 in abundance, and provisions according to that which the Lord had
 commanded us, we did go down into the ship, with all our loading
 and our seeds, and whatsoever thing we had brought with us, every
 one according to his age; wherefore, we did all go down into the
 ship, with our wives and our children.
 
 And now, my father had begat two sons in the wilderness; the
 elder was called Jacob and the younger Joseph.
 
 And it came to pass after we had all gone down into the ship,
 and had taken with us our provisions and things which had been
 commanded us, we did put forth into the sea and were driven forth
 before the wind towards the promised land.
 
 And after we had been driven forth before the wind for the
 space of many days, behold, my brethren and the sons of Ishmael
 and also their wives began to make themselves merry, insomuch
 that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much
 rudeness, yea, even that they did forget by what power they had
 been brought thither; yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding
 rudeness.
 
 And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly lest the Lord should
 be angry with us, and smite us because of our iniquity, that we
 should be swallowed up in the depths of the sea; wherefore, I,
 Nephi, began to speak to them with much soberness; but behold
 they were angry with me, saying: We will not that our younger
 brother shall be a ruler over us.
 
 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and
 bind me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness;
 nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it that he might show forth his
 power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he had spoken
 concerning the wicked.
 
 And it came to pass that after they had bound me insomuch
 that I could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of
 the Lord, did cease to work.
 
 Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship,
 insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and
 terrible tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters for the
 space of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly
 lest they should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless they did not
 loose me.
 
 And on the fourth day, which we had been driven back, the
 tempest began to be exceedingly sore.
 
 And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in
 the depths of the sea. And after we had been driven back upon
 the waters for the space of four days, my brethren began to see
 that the judgments of God were upon them, and that they must
 perish save that they should repent of their iniquities;
 wherefore, they came unto me, and loosed the bands which were
 upon my wrist, and behold they had swollen exceedingly; and also
 mine ankles were much swollen, and great was the soreness
 thereof.
 
 Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him
 all the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord because
 of mine afflictions.
 
 Now my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them, and also
 unto the sons of Ishmael; but, behold, they did breathe out much
 threatenings against anyone that should speak for me; and my
 parents being stricken in years, and having suffered much grief
 because of their children, they were brought down, yea, even upon
 their sick-beds.
 
 Because of their grief and much sorrow, and the iniquity of
 my brethren, they were brought near even to be carried out of
 this time to meet their God; yea, their grey hairs were about to
 be brought down to lie low in the dust; yea, even they were near
 to be cast with sorrow into a watery grave.
 
 And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having need of much
 nourishment, were grieved because of the afflictions of their
 mother; and also my wife with her tears and prayers, and also my
 children, did not soften the hearts of my brethren that they
 would loose me.
 
 And there was nothing save it were the power of God, which
 threatened them with destruction, could soften their hearts;
 wherefore, when they saw that they were about to be swallowed up
 in the depths of the sea they repented of the thing which they
 had done, insomuch that they loosed me.
 
 And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took
 the compass, and it did work whither I desired it. And it came
 to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the
 winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great
 calm.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that
 we sailed again towards the promised land.
 
 And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of
 many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth
 upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the
 promised land.
 
 And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and
 we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the
 earth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And it
 came to pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were
 blessed in abundance.
 
 And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of
 promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were
 beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and
 the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all
 manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And we
 did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of
 copper.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I
 did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record
 of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven
 the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the
 wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also many of
 mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.
 
 And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be
 commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record
 of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part
 of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those
 first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which
 transpired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more
 particularly made mention upon the first plates.
 
 And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I,
 Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the
 prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be
 written upon these plates; and that the things which were written
 should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should
 possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which
 purposes are known unto the Lord.
 
 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates,
 which gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the
 wars and contentions and destructions of my people. And this
 have I done, and commanded my people what they should do after I
 was gone; and that these plates should be handed down from one
 generation to another, or from one prophet to another, until
 further commandments of the Lord.
 
 And an account of my making these plates shall be given
 hereafter; and then, behold, I proceed according to that which I
 have spoken; and this I do that the more sacred things may be
 kept for the knowledge of my people.
 
 Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon plates save it be
 that I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they
 err of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men,
 but because of the weakness which is in me, according to the
 flesh, I would excuse myself.
 
 For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth,
 both to the body and soul, others set at naught and trample under
 their feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel do men trample
 under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would
 speak in other words--they set him at naught, and hearken not to
 the voice of his counsels.
 
 And behold he cometh, according to the words of the angel, in
 six hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.
 
 And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to
 be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he
 suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they
 spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving
 kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.
 
 And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of
 bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea,
 the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth
 himself, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the
 hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of
 Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and
 to be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos,
 which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which
 should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit
 the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of
 the house of Israel.
 
 For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit
 all the house of Israel at that day, some with his voice, because
 of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation, and
 others with the thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by
 tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by the
 opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up.
 
 And all these things must surely come, saith the prophet
 Zenos. And the rocks of the earth must rend; and because of the
 groanings of the earth, many of the kings of the isles of the sea
 shall be wrought upon by the Spirit of God, to exclaim: The God
 of nature suffers.
 
 And as for those who are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet,
 they shall be scourged by all people, because they crucify the
 God of Israel, and turn their hearts aside, rejecting signs and
 wonders, and the power and glory of the God of Israel.
 
 And because they turn their hearts aside, saith the prophet,
 and have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in
 the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be
 hated among all nations.
 
 Nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that
 they no more turn aside their hearts against the Holy One of
 Israel, then will he remember the covenants which he made to
 their fathers.
 
 Yea, then will he remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all
 the people who are of the house of Israel, will I gather in,
 saith the Lord, according to the words of the prophet Zenos, from
 the four quarters of the earth.
 
 Yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of the Lord,
 saith the prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue and people shall
 be blessed.
 
 And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that
 perhaps I might persuade them that they would remember the Lord
 their Redeemer.
 
 Wherefore, I speak unto all the house of Israel, if it so be
 that they should obtain these things.
 
 For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth weary
 me even that all my joints are weak, for those who are at
 Jerusalem; for had not the Lord been merciful, to show unto me
 concerning them, even as he had prophets of old, I should have
 perished also.
 
 And he surely did show unto the prophets of old all things
 concerning them; and also he did show unto many concerning us;
 wherefore, it must needs be that we know concerning them for they
 are written upon the plates of brass.
 
 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren
 these things; and it came to pass that I did read many things to
 them, which were engraven upon the plates of brass, that they
 might know concerning the doings of the Lord in other lands,
 among people of old.
 
 And I did read many things unto them which were written in
 the books of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to
 believe in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that
 which was written by the prophet Isaiah; for I did liken all
 scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning.
 
 Wherefore I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the
 prophet, ye who are a remnant of the house of Israel, a branch
 who have been broken off; hear ye the words of the prophet, which
 were written unto all the house of Israel, and liken them unto
 yourselves, that ye may have hope as well as your brethren from
 whom ye have been broken off; for after this manner has the
 prophet written.
 
 
 Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the
 name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or
 out of the waters of baptism, who swear by the name of the Lord,
 and make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in
 truth nor in righteousness.
 
 Nevertheless, they call themselves of the holy city, but they
 do not stay themselves upon the God of Israel, who is the Lord of
 Hosts; yea, the Lord of Hosts is his name.
 
 Behold, I have declared the former things from the beginning;
 and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them. I did
 show them suddenly.
 
 And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy
 neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;
 
 And I have even from the beginning declared to thee; before it
 came to pass I showed them thee; and I showed them for fear lest
 thou shouldst say--mine idol hath done them, and my graven image,
 and my molten image hath commanded them.
 
 Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare
 them? And that I have showed thee new things from this time,
 even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.
 
 They are created now, and not from the beginning, even before
 the day when thou heardest them not they were declared unto thee,
 lest thou shouldst say--Behold I knew them.
 
 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from
 that time thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldst
 deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the
 womb.
 
 Nevertheless, for my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and
 for my praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off.
 
 For, behold, I have refined thee, I have chosen thee in the
 furnace of affliction.
 
 For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake will I do this, for
 I will not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my
 glory unto another.
 
 Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called, for I am he;
 I am the first, and I am also the last.
 
 Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the earth, and my
 right hand hath spanned the heavens. I call unto them and they
 stand up together.
 
 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath
 declared these things unto them? The Lord hath loved him; yea,
 and he will fulfill his word which he hath declared by them; and
 he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall come upon
 the Chaldeans.
 
 Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord, yea, I have spoken; yea, I
 have called him to declare, I have brought him, and he shall make
 his way prosperous.
 
 Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in secret; from the
 beginning, from the time that it was declared have I spoken; and
 the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.
 
 And thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of
 Israel; I have sent him, the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to
 profit, who leadeth thee by the way thou shouldst go, hath done
 it.
 
 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments--then had thy
 peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the
 sea.
 
 Thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy
 bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut
 off nor destroyed from before me.
 
 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
 voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter to the end of the
 earth; say ye: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.
 
 And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts; he
 caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the
 rock also and the waters gushed out.
 
 And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also,
 there is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.
 
 
 And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are
 broken off and are driven out because of the wickedness of the
 pastors of my people; yea, all ye that are broken off, that are
 scattered abroad, who are of my people, O house of Israel.
 Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken ye people from far; the
 Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother
 hath he made mention of my name.
 
 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
 his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his
 quiver hath he hid me;
 
 And said unto me: Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I
 will be glorified.
 
 Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength
 for naught and in vain; surely my judgment is with the Lord, and
 my work with my God.
 
 And now, saith the Lord--that formed me from the womb that I
 should be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him--though Israel
 be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord,
 and my God shall be my strength.
 
 And he said: It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my
 servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the
 preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the
 Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the
 earth.
 
 Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to
 him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to
 servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall
 worship, because of the Lord that is faithful.
 
 Thus saith the Lord: In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
 O isles of the sea, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee;
 and I will preserve thee, and give thee my servant for a covenant
 of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the
 desolate heritages;
 
 That thou mayest say to the prisoners: Go forth; to them that
 sit in darkness: Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways,
 and their pastures shall be in all high places.
 
 They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor
 the sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them shall lead
 them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.
 
 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall
 be exalted.
 
 And then, O house of Israel, behold, these shall come from
 far; and lo, these from the north and from the west; and these
 from the land of Sinim.
 
 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of
 those who are in the east shall be established; and break forth
 into singing, O mountains; for they shall be smitten no more; for
 the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his
 afflicted.
 
 But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and
 my Lord hath forgotten me--but he will show that he hath not.
 
 For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not
 have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget,
 yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.
 
 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
 walls are continually before me.
 
 Thy children shall make haste against thy destroyers; and
 they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
 
 Lift up thine eyes round about and behold; all these gather
 themselves together, and they shall come to thee. And as I live,
 saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as
 with an ornament, and bind them on even as a bride.
 
 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
 destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the
 inhabitants; and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.
 
 The children whom thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the
 first, shall again in thine ears say: The place is too strait for
 me; give place to me that I may dwell.
 
 Then shalt thou say in thine heart: Who hath begotten me
 these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a
 captive, and removing to and fro? And who hath brought up these?
 
 Behold, I was left alone; these, where have they been?
 
 Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to
 the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they
 shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be
 carried upon their shoulders.
 
 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
 nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face
 towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou
 shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that
 wait for me.
 
 For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
 captives delivered?
 
 But thus saith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty
 shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
 delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee,
 and I will save thy children.
 
 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;
 they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine;
 and all flesh shall know that I, the Lord, am thy Savior and thy
 Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had read these
 things which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren
 came unto me and said unto me: What meaneth these things which ye
 have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to things
 which are spiritual, which shall come to pass according to the
 spirit and not the flesh?
 
 And I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were manifest unto
 the prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for by the Spirit are all
 things made known unto the prophets, which shall come upon the
 children of men according to the flesh.
 
 Wherefore, the things of which I have read are things
 pertaining to things both temporal and spiritual; for it appears
 that the house of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon
 all the face of the earth, and also among all nations.
 
 And behold, there are many who are already lost from the
 knowledge of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of
 all the tribes have been led away; and they are scattered to and
 fro upon the isles of the sea; and whither they are none of us
 knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.
 
 And since they have been led away, these things have been
 prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all those who
 shall hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the
 Holy One of Israel; for against him will they harden their
 hearts; wherefore, they shall be scattered among all nations and
 shall be hated of all men.
 
 Nevertheless, after they shall be nursed by the Gentiles, and
 the Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up
 for a standard, and their children have been carried in their
 arms, and their daughters have been carried upon their shoulders,
 behold these things of which are spoken are temporal; for thus
 are the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us
 in the days to come, and also all our brethren who are of the
 house of Israel.
 
 And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the house
 of Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God
 will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon
 the face of this land; and by them shall our seed be scattered.
 
 And after our seed is scattered the Lord God will proceed to
 do a marvelous work among the Gentiles, which shall be of great
 worth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being
 nourished by the Gentiles and being carried in their arms and
 upon their shoulders.
 
 And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only
 unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the
 making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto
 Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth
 be blessed.
 
 And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the
 kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare
 his arm in the eyes of the nations.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in
 the eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and
 his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.
 
 Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and
 they shall be gathered together to the lands of their
 inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out
 of darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is their Savior
 and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.
 
 And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is
 the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; for
 they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands
 shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with
 their own blood.
 
 And every nation which shall war against thee, O house of
 Israel, shall be turned one against another, and they shall fall
 into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord.
 
 And all that fight against Zion shall be destroyed, and that
 great whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea,
 that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the dust and
 great shall be the fall of it.
 
 For behold, saith the prophet, the time cometh speedily that
 Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of
 men; for the day soon cometh that all the proud and they who do
 wickedly shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must
 be burned.
 
 For the time soon cometh that the fulness of the wrath of God
 shall be poured out upon all the children of men; for he will not
 suffer that the wicked shall destroy the righteous.
 
 Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even
 if it so be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the
 righteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of their
 enemies by fire. Wherefore, the righteous need not fear; for
 thus saith the prophet, they shall be saved, even if it so be as
 by fire.
 
 Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that these things must
 shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must
 come; and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it
 cometh unto men according to the flesh if it so be that they will
 harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel.
 
 For behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time
 surely must come that all they who fight against Zion shall be
 cut off.
 
 And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people, unto
 the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A
 prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me;
 him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
 
 And it shall come to pass that all those who will not hear that
 prophet shall be cut off from among the people.
 
 And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this prophet of whom
 Moses spake was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he shall
 execute judgment in righteousness.
 
 And the righteous need not fear, for they are those who shall
 not be confounded. But it is the kingdom of the devil, which
 shall be built up among the children of men, which kingdom is
 established among them which are in the flesh--
 
 For the time speedily shall come that all churches which are
 built up to get gain, and all those who are built up to get power
 over the flesh, and those who are built up to become popular in
 the eyes of the world, and those who seek the lusts of the flesh
 and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity;
 yea, in fine, all those who belong to the kingdom of the devil
 are they who need fear, and tremble, and quake; they are those
 who must be brought low in the dust; they are those who must be
 consumed as stubble; and this is according to the words of the
 prophet.
 
 And the time cometh speedily that the righteous must be led
 up as calves of the stall, and the Holy One of Israel must reign
 in dominion, and might, and power, and great glory.
 
 And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the
 earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there
 shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep,
 and in him they shall find pasture.
 
 And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan has no
 power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many
 years; for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for
 they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel reigneth.
 
 And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you that all these things
 must come according to the flesh.
 
 But, behold, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people shall
 dwell safely in the Holy One of Israel if it so be that they will
 repent.
 
 And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not speak further
 as yet concerning these things.
 
 Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that
 the things which have been written upon the plates of brass are
 true; and they testify that a man must be obedient to the
 commandments of God.
 
 Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the
 only ones that have testified, and also taught them. Wherefore,
 if ye shall be obedient to the commandments, and endure to the
 end, ye shall be saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen.
 
 2 Nephi
 THE SECOND BOOK OF NEPHI
 An account of the death of Lehi. Nephi's brethren rebel against
 him. The Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness. His
 journeyings in the wilderness, and so forth.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end
 of teaching my brethren, our father, Lehi, also spake many things
 unto them, and rehearsed unto them, how great things the Lord had
 done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.
 
 And he spake unto them concerning their rebellions upon the
 waters, and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they
 were not swallowed up in the sea.
 
 And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise,
 which they had obtained--how merciful the Lord had been in
 warning us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem.
 
 For, behold, said he, I have seen a vision, in which I know
 that Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem we
 should also have perished.
 
 But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have
 obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all
 other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me
 should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord
 hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever,
 and also all those who should be led out of other countries by
 the hand of the Lord.
 
 Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the
 Spirit which is in me, that there shall none come into this land
 save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.
 
 Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall
 bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to
 the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of
 liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down
 into captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if
 iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes,
 but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.
 
 And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet
 from the knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations
 would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an
 inheritance.
 
 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as
 those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem
 shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of
 this land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that
 they may possess this land unto themselves. And if it so be that
 they shall keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the
 face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to
 take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell
 safely forever.
 
 But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in
 unbelief, after they have received so great blessings from the
 hand of the Lord--having a knowledge of the creation of the
 earth, and all men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the
 Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to
 do all things by faith; having all the commandments from the
 beginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into
 this precious land of promise--behold, I say, if the day shall
 come that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true
 Messiah, their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of
 him that is just shall rest upon them.
 
 Yea, he will bring other nations unto them, and he will give
 unto them power, and he will take away from them the lands of
 their possessions, and he will cause them to be scattered and
 smitten.
 
 Yea, as one generation passeth to another there shall be
 bloodsheds, and great visitations among them; wherefore, my sons,
 I would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would
 hearken unto my words.
 
 O that ye would awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even
 from the sleep of hell, and shake off the awful chains by which
 ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of
 men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal gulf
 of misery and woe.
 
 Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a
 trembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold
 and silent grave, from whence no traveler can return; a few more
 days and I go the way of all the earth.
 
 But behold, the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have
 beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms
 of his love.
 
 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the statutes
 and the judgments of the Lord; behold, this hath been the anxiety
 of my soul from the beginning.
 
 My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to
 time, for I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts the
 Lord your God should come out in the fulness of his wrath upon
 you, that ye be cut off and destroyed forever;
 
 Or, that a cursing should come upon you for the space of many
 generations; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are
 hated, and are led according to the will and captivity of the
 devil.
 
 O my sons, that these things might not come upon you, but
 that ye might be a choice and a favored people of the Lord. But
 behold, his will be done; for his ways are righteousness forever.
 
 And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my
 commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye
 will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my
 presence.
 
 And now that my soul might have joy in you, and that my heart
 might leave this world with gladness because of you, that I might
 not be brought down with grief and sorrow to the grave, arise
 from the dust, my sons, and be men, and be determined in one mind
 and in one heart, united in all things, that ye may not come down
 into captivity;
 
 That ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing; and also, that
 ye may not incur the displeasure of a just God upon you, unto the
 destruction, yea, the eternal destruction of both soul and body.
 
 Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off
 the chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of
 obscurity, and arise from the dust.
 
 Rebel no more against your brother, whose views have been
 glorious, and who hath kept the commandments from the time that
 we left Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands
 of God, in bringing us forth into the land of promise; for were
 it not for him, we must have perished with hunger in the
 wilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to take away his life; yea,
 and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you.
 
 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest he
 shall suffer again; for behold, ye have accused him that he
 sought power and authority over you; but I know that he hath not
 sought for power nor authority over you, but he hath sought the
 glory of God, and your own eternal welfare.
 
 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you. Ye
 say that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry
 with you; but behold, his sharpness was the sharpness of the
 power of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye
 call anger was the truth, according to that which is in God,
 which he could not restrain, manifesting boldly concerning your
 iniquities.
 
 And it must needs be that the power of God must be with him,
 even unto his commanding you that ye must obey. But behold, it
 was not he, but it was the Spirit of the Lord which was in him,
 which opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it.
 
 And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my
 sons who are the sons of Ishmael, behold, if ye will hearken unto
 the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish. And if ye will hearken
 unto him I leave unto you a blessing, yea, even my first
 blessing.
 
 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my first
 blessing, yea, even my blessing, and it shall rest upon him.
 
 And now Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the servant
 of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast been brought out of the land of
 Jerusalem, and I know that thou art a true friend unto my son,
 Nephi, forever.
 
 Wherefore, because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be
 blessed with his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon
 the face of this land; and nothing, save it shall be iniquity
 among them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face
 of this land forever.
 
 Wherefore, if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the
 Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with
 the seed of my son.
 
 
 And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my first-born in
 the days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And behold, in thy
 childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because
 of the rudeness of thy brethren.
 
 Nevertheless, Jacob, my first-born in the wilderness, thou
 knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine
 afflictions for thy gain.
 
 Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell
 safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be spent in
 the service of thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou art
 redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou
 hast beheld that in the fulness of time he cometh to bring
 salvation unto men.
 
 And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou
 art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the
 flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.
 
 And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is
 free.
 
 And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from
 evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is
 justified; or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal
 law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish
 from that which is good, and become miserable forever.
 
 Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah;
 for he is full of grace and truth.
 
 Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the
 ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a
 contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be
 answered.
 
 Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known
 unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there
 is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be
 through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who
 layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again
 by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the
 resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.
 
 Wherefore, he is the first-fruits unto God, inasmuch as he
 shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they
 that believe in him shall be saved.
 
 And because of the intercession for all, all men come unto
 God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him to be judged of
 him according to the truth and holiness which is in him.
 Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given,
 unto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which
 punishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the
 happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement--
 
 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all
 things. If not so, my first-born in the wilderness,
 righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness,
 neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore,
 all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it
 should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life
 neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor
 misery, neither sense nor insensibility.
 
 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of
 naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of
 its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the
 wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and
 the mercy, and the justice of God.
 
 And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there
 is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say
 there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness
 there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor
 happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things
 are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not,
 neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of
 things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all
 things must have vanished away.
 
 And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your
 profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all
 things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in
 them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.
 
 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man,
 after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the
 field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are
 created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the
 forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being
 sweet and the other bitter.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for
 himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should
 be that he was enticed by the one or the other.
 
 And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read, must
 needs suppose that an angel of God, according to that which is
 written, had fallen from heaven; wherefore, he became a devil,
 having sought that which was evil before God.
 
 And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become
 miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind.
 Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is
 the devil, who is the father of all lies, wherefore he said:
 Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye
 shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
 
 And after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit
 they were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth.
 
 And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of
 all the earth.
 
 And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according
 to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh;
 wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their
 time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord
 God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that
 all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were
 lost, because of the transgression of their parents.
 
 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not
 have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden.
 And all things which were created must have remained in the same
 state in which they were after they were created; and they must
 have remained forever, and had no end.
 
 And they would have had no children; wherefore they would
 have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they
 knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.
 
 But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him
 who knoweth all things.
 
 Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might
 have joy.
 
 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may
 redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they
 are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing
 good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon,
 save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last
 day, according to the commandments which God hath given.
 
 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all
 things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are
 free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great
 Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according
 to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all
 men might be miserable like unto himself.
 
 And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great
 Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be
 faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to
 the will of his Holy Spirit;
 
 And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the
 flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of
 the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he
 may reign over you in his own kingdom.
 
 I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the
 last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part,
 according to the words of the prophet. And I have none other
 object save it be the everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.
 
 
 And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last-born. Thou wast
 born in the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of
 my greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee.
 
 And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this land, which is
 a most precious land, for thine inheritance and the inheritance
 of thy seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if it so
 be that ye shall keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel.
 
 And now, Joseph, my last-born, whom I have brought out of the
 wilderness of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee forever,
 for thy seed shall not utterly be destroyed.
 
 For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a
 descendant of Joseph who was carried captive into Egypt. And
 great were the covenants of the Lord which he made unto Joseph.
 
 Wherefore, Joseph truly saw our day. And he obtained a
 promise of the Lord, that out of the fruit of his loins the Lord
 God would raise up a righteous branch unto the house of Israel;
 not the Messiah, but a branch which was to be broken off,
 nevertheless, to be remembered in the covenants of the Lord that
 the Messiah should be made manifest unto them in the latter days,
 in the spirit of power, unto the bringing of them out of darkness
 unto light--yea, out of hidden darkness and out of captivity unto
 freedom.
 
 For Joseph truly testified, saying: A seer shall the Lord my
 God raise up, who shall be a choice seer unto the fruit of my
 loins.
 
 Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice
 seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall
 be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins. And unto him
 will I give commandment that he shall do a work for the fruit of
 thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them,
 even to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants
 which I have made with thy fathers.
 
 And I will give unto him a commandment that he shall do none
 other work, save the work which I shall command him. And I will
 make him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work.
 
 And he shall be great like unto Moses, whom I have said I
 would raise up unto you, to deliver my people, O house of Israel.
 
 And Moses will I raise up, to deliver thy people out of the
 land of Egypt.
 
 But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and
 unto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed
 of thy loins--and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith
 the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have
 already gone forth among them.
 
 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit
 of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be
 written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be
 written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together,
 unto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of
 contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins,
 and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter
 days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.
 
 And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when
 my work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring
 thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.
 
 And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold, that seer will
 the Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him shall be
 confounded; for this promise, which I have obtained of the Lord,
 of the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am sure
 of the fulfilling of this promise;
 
 And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after
 the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the
 thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power
 of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.
 
 Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I am sure of this thing, even as
 I am sure of the promise of Moses; for the Lord hath said unto
 me, I will preserve thy seed forever.
 
 And the Lord hath said: I will raise up a Moses; and I will
 give power unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him
 in writing. Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak
 much, for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I will
 write unto him my law, by the finger of mine own hand; and I will
 make a spokesman for him.
 
 And the Lord said unto me also: I will raise up unto the
 fruit of thy loins; and I will make for him a spokesman. And I,
 behold, I will give unto him that he shall write the writing of
 the fruit of thy loins, unto the fruit of thy loins; and the
 spokesman of thy loins shall declare it.
 
 And the words which he shall write shall be the words which
 are expedient in my wisdom should go forth unto the fruit of thy
 loins. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried
 unto them from the dust; for I know their faith.
 
 And they shall cry from the dust; yea, even repentance unto
 their brethren, even after many generations have gone by them.
 And it shall come to pass that their cry shall go, even according
 to the simpleness of their words.
 
 Because of their faith their words shall proceed forth out of
 my mouth unto their brethren who are the fruit of thy loins; and
 the weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith,
 unto the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy
 fathers.
 
 And now, behold, my son Joseph, after this manner did my
 father of old prophesy.
 
 Wherefore, because of this covenant thou art blessed; for thy
 seed shall not be destroyed, for they shall hearken unto the
 words of the book.
 
 And there shall rise up one mighty among them, who shall do
 much good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the
 hands of God, with exceeding faith, to work mighty wonders, and
 do that thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the
 bringing to pass much restoration unto the house of Israel, and
 unto the seed of thy brethren.
 
 And now, blessed art thou, Joseph. Behold, thou art little;
 wherefore hearken unto the words of thy brother, Nephi, and it
 shall be done unto thee even according to the words which I have
 spoken. Remember the words of thy dying father. Amen.
 
 
 And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my
 father hath spoken, concerning Joseph, who was carried into
 Egypt.
 
 For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And
 the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And
 he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they
 are written upon the plates of brass.
 
 Wherefore, after my father had made an end of speaking
 concerning the prophecies of Joseph, he called the children of
 Laman, his sons, and his daughters, and said unto them: Behold,
 my sons, and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of
 my first-born, I would that ye should give ear unto my words.
 
 For the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my
 commandments ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye
 will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my
 presence.
 
 But behold, my sons and my daughters, I cannot go down to my
 grave save I should leave a blessing upon you; for behold, I know
 that if ye are brought up in the way ye should go ye will not
 depart from it.
 
 Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my blessing upon
 you, that the cursing may be taken from you and be answered upon
 the heads of your parents.
 
 Wherefore, because of my blessing the Lord God will not suffer
 that ye shall perish; wherefore, he will be merciful unto you and
 unto your seed forever.
 
 And it came to pass that after my father had made an end of
 speaking to the sons and daughters of Laman, he caused the sons
 and daughters of Lemuel to be brought before him.
 
 And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons and my
 daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my second son;
 behold I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the
 sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be
 destroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed.
 
 And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of
 speaking unto them, behold, he spake unto the sons of Ishmael,
 yea, and even all his household.
 
 And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake
 unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed; for thou shall
 inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall
 be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy
 brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be
 blessed in all thy days.
 
 And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had spoken unto
 all his household, according to the feelings of his heart and the
 Spirit of the Lord which was in him, he waxed old. And it came
 to pass that he died, and was buried.
 
 And it came to pass that not many days after his death, Laman
 and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael were angry with me because of
 the admonitions of the Lord.
 
 For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according
 to his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my
 father, before his death; many of which sayings are written upon
 mine other plates; for a more history part are written upon mine
 other plates.
 
 And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the
 scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my
 soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them,
 and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.
 
 Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my
 heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and
 heard.
 
 Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord,
 in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth:
 O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my
 flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.
 
 I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the
 sins which do so easily beset me.
 
 And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my
 sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.
 
 My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine
 afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the
 waters of the great deep.
 
 He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of
 my flesh.
 
 He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to
 quake before me.
 
 Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me
 knowledge by visions in the nighttime.
 
 And by day have I waxed bold in mighty prayer before him;
 yea, my voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and
 ministered unto me.
 
 And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been carried
 away upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld
 great things, yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden
 that I should not write them.
 
 O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his
 condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so
 much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the
 valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength
 slacken, because of mine afflictions?
 
 And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why
 should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in
 my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry
 because of mine enemy?
 
 Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my
 heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.
 
 Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken
 my strength because of mine afflictions.
 
 Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord,
 I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my
 God, and the rock of my salvation.
 
 O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out
 of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake
 at the appearance of sin?
 
 May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because
 that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt
 thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I
 may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in
 the plain road!
 
 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy
 righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape
 before mine enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me!
 Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way--but that thou
 wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the
 ways of mine enemy.
 
 O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee
 forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know
 that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh.
 Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh
 his arm.
 
 Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh.
 Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will
 lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God,
 the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever
 ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.
 
 
 Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the
 Lord my God, because of the anger of my brethren.
 
 But behold, their anger did increase against me, insomuch that
 they did seek to take away my life.
 
 Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother
 thinks to rule over us; and we have had much trial because of
 him; wherefore, now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted
 more because of his words. For behold, we will not have him to
 be our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are the elder brethren,
 to rule over this people.
 
 Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they
 murmured against me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they did
 seek to take away my life.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi,
 should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all
 those who would go with me.
 
 Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family,
 and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and
 his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also
 my sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all those
 who would go with me were those who believed in the warnings and
 the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my
 words.
 
 And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible
 for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many
 days. And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we
 did pitch our tents.
 
 And my people would that we should call the name of the place
 Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi.
 
 And all those who were with me did take upon them to call
 themselves the people of Nephi.
 
 And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes,
 and the commandments of the Lord in all things according to the
 law of Moses.
 
 And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly; for
 we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we
 began to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.
 
 And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which were
 engraven upon the plates of brass; and also the ball, or compass,
 which was prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord,
 according to that which is written.
 
 And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly, and
 to multiply in the land.
 
 And I, Nephi, did take the sword of Laban, and after the
 manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people
 who were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us;
 for I knew their hatred towards me and my children and those who
 were called my people.
 
 And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in
 all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and
 of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which
 were in great abundance.
 
 And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it
 after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built
 of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon
 the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's
 temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the
 temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly
 fine.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be
 industrious, and to labor with their hands.
 
 And it came to pass that they would that I should be their
 king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king;
 nevertheless, I did for them according to that which was in my
 power.
 
 And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my
 brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their
 ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, I had been their ruler and
 their teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until
 the time they sought to take away my life.
 
 Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake
 unto me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy
 words they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And
 behold, they were cut off from his presence.
 
 And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a
 sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had
 hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto
 a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and
 delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the
 Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.
 
 And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be
 loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their
 iniquities.
 
 And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their
 seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing. And
 the Lord spake it, and it was done.
 
 And because of their cursing which was upon them they did
 become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did
 seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey.
 
 And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be a scourge unto
 thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as
 they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall
 scourge them even unto destruction.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did consecrate Jacob and
 Joseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the land of
 my people.
 
 And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of
 happiness.
 
 And thirty years had passed away from the time we left
 Jerusalem.
 
 And I, Nephi, had kept the records upon my plates, which I
 had made, of my people thus far.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me: Make
 other plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them which
 are good in my sight, for the profit of thy people.
 
 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of
 the Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven
 these things.
 
 And I engraved that which is pleasing unto God. And if my
 people are pleased with the things of God they will be pleased
 with mine engravings which are upon these plates.
 
 And if my people desire to know the more particular part of
 the history of my people they must search mine other plates.
 
 And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had passed away,
 and we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.
 
 
 The words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which he spake unto
 the people of Nephi:
 
 Behold, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, having been called of
 God, and ordained after the manner of his holy order, and having
 been consecrated by my brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a king
 or a protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know
 that I have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.
 
 Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am desirous for
 the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you;
 and ye yourselves know that it ever has been. For I have
 exhorted you with all diligence; and I have taught you the words
 of my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning all things
 which are written, from the creation of the world.
 
 And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things
 which are, and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the
 words of Isaiah. And they are the words which my brother has
 desired that I should speak unto you. And I speak unto you for
 your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.
 
 And now, the words which I shall read are they which Isaiah
 spake concerning all the house of Israel; wherefore, they may be
 likened unto you, for ye are of the house of Israel. And there
 are many things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may be
 likened unto you, because ye are of the house of Israel.
 
 And now these are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold,
 I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard
 to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and
 thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
 
 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
 nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their faces
 towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou
 shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that
 wait for me.
 
 And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat concerning these words.
 
 For behold, the Lord has shown me that those who were at
 Jerusalem, from whence we came, have been slain and carried away
 captive.
 
 Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that they should
 return again. And he also has shown unto me that the Lord God,
 the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the
 flesh; and after he should manifest himself they should scourge
 him and crucify him, according to the words of the angel who
 spake it unto me.
 
 And after they have hardened their hearts and stiffened their
 necks against the Holy One of Israel, behold the judgments of the
 Holy One of Israel shall come upon them. And the day cometh that
 they shall be smitten and afflicted.
 
 Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith
 the angel, many shall be afflicted in the flesh, and shall not be
 suffered to perish, because of the prayers of the faithful; they
 shall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the
 Lord will be merciful unto them, that when they shall come to the
 knowledge of their Redeemer, they shall be gathered together
 again to the lands of their inheritance.
 
 And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has
 written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight
 not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and
 abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will
 fulfil his covenants which he has made unto his children; and for
 this cause the prophet has written these things.
 
 Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant
 people of the Lord shall lick up the dust of their feet; and the
 people of the Lord shall not be ashamed. For the people of the
 Lord are they who wait for him; for they still wait for the
 coming of the Messiah.
 
 And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the
 Messiah will set himself again the second time to recover them;
 wherefore, he will manifest himself unto them in power and great
 glory, unto the destruction of their enemies, when that day
 cometh when they shall believe in him; and none will he destroy
 that believe in him.
 
 And they that believe not in him shall be destroyed, both by
 fire, and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and
 by pestilence, and by famine. And they shall know that the Lord
 is God, the Holy One of Israel.
 
 For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful
 captive delivered?
 
 But thus saith the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty
 shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
 delivered; for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people.
 For thus saith the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth
 with thee--
 
 And I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh;
 and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet
 wine; and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Savior and
 thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
 
 
 Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I
 cast thee off forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is the
 bill of your mother's divorcement? To whom have I put thee away,
 or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I
 sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves,
 and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
 
 Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I called, yea,
 there was none to answer. O house of Israel, is my hand
 shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to
 deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make their
 rivers a wilderness and their fish to stink because the waters
 are dried up, and they die because of thirst.
 
 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
 their covering.
 
 The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
 should know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O house of
 Israel. When ye are weary he waketh morning by morning. He
 waketh mine ear to hear as the learned.
 
 The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
 neither turned away back.
 
 I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to them that
 plucked off the hair. I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
 
 For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be
 confounded. Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I
 know that I shall not be ashamed.
 
 And the Lord is near, and he justifieth me. Who will contend
 with me? Let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? Let him
 come near me, and I will smite him with the strength of my mouth.
 
 For the Lord God will help me. And all they who shall condemn
 me, behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, and the moth
 shall eat them up.
 
 Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the
 voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?
 
 Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass yourselves about
 with sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks
 which ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand--ye shall
 lie down in sorrow.
 
 
 Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness. Look
 unto the rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit
 from whence ye are digged.
 
 Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah, she that bare
 you; for I called him alone, and blessed him.
 
 For the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will comfort all her waste
 places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert
 like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found
 therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.
 
 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation;
 for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to
 rest for a light for the people.
 
 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
 arm shall judge the people. The isles shall wait upon me, and on
 mine arm shall they trust.
 
 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
 beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
 earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein
 shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever, and
 my righteousness shall not be abolished.
 
 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
 whose heart I have written my law, fear ye not the reproach of
 men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.
 
 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
 shall eat them like wool. But my righteousness shall be forever,
 and my salvation from generation to generation.
 
 Awake, awake! Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in
 the ancient days. Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and
 wounded the dragon?
 
 Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the waters of the
 great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
 ransomed to pass over?
 
 Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come
 with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness shall be
 upon their heads; and they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow
 and mourning shall flee away.
 
 I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you. Behold, who art
 thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of man, who shall die, and of
 the son of man, who shall be made like unto grass?
 
 And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth
 the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast
 feared continually every day, because of the fury of the
 oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury
 of the oppressor?
 
 The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that
 he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.
 
 But I am the Lord thy God, whose waves roared; the Lord of
 Hosts is my name.
 
 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee
 in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay
 the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: Behold, thou art
 my people.
 
 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
 hand of the Lord the cup of his fury--thou hast drunken the dregs
 of the cup of trembling wrung out--
 
 And none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought
 forth; neither that taketh her by the hand, of all the sons she
 hath brought up.
 
 These two sons are come unto thee, who shall be sorry for
 thee--thy desolation and destruction, and the famine and the
 sword--and by whom shall I comfort thee?
 
 Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head
 of all the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the
 fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.
 
 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not
 with wine:
 
 Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause
 of his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of
 trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more
 drink it again.
 
 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;
 who have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over--and
 thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them
 that went over.
 
 Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy
 beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth
 there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the
 unclean.
 
 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem;
 loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of
 Zion.
 
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye
 might know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has
 covenanted with all the house of Israel--
 
 That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy
 prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to
 generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to
 the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home
 to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in
 all their lands of promise.
 
 Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things
 that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of
 the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.
 
 For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of
 things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must
 waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.
 
 Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show
 himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is
 expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the
 great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto
 man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become
 subject unto him.
 
 For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful
 plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of
 resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by
 reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression;
 and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence
 of the Lord.
 
 Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement--save it
 should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on
 incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man
 must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this
 flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother
 earth, to rise no more.
 
 O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the
 flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that
 angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and
 became the devil, to rise no more.
 
 And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become
 devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of
 our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like
 unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents,
 who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and
 stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of
 murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.
 
 O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for
 our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that
 monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and
 also the death of the spirit.
 
 And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy
 One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the
 temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.
 
 And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual
 death, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell;
 wherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell
 must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver
 up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will
 be restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the
 resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.
 
 O how great the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the
 paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and
 the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit
 and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become
 incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a
 perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our
 knowledge shall be perfect.
 
 Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our
 guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous
 shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their
 righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe
 of righteousness.
 
 And it shall come to pass that when all men shall have passed
 from this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become
 immortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy
 One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they
 be judged according to the holy judgment of God.
 
 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath
 spoken it, and it is his eternal word, which cannot pass away,
 that they who are righteous shall be righteous still, and they
 who are filthy shall be filthy still; wherefore, they who are
 filthy are the devil and his angels; and they shall go away into
 everlasting fire; prepared for them; and their torment is as a
 lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and
 ever and has no end.
 
 O the greatness and the justice of our God! For he executeth
 all his words, and they have gone forth out of his mouth, and his
 law must be fulfilled.
 
 But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of
 Israel, they who have believed in the Holy One of Israel, they
 who have endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame
 of it, they shall inherit the kingdom of God, which was prepared
 for them from the foundation of the world, and their joy shall be
 full forever.
 
 O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of
 Israel! For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster the
 devil, and death, and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone,
 which is endless torment.
 
 O how great the holiness of our God! For he knoweth all
 things, and there is not anything save he knows it.
 
 And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they
 will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains
 of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men,
 women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.
 
 And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon
 all men, that all might stand before him at the great and
 judgment day.
 
 And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be
 baptized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of
 Israel, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.
 
 And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be
 baptized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned;
 for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.
 
 Wherefore, he has given a law; and where there is no law
 given there is no punishment; and where there is no punishment
 there is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation the
 mercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because
 of the atonement; for they are delivered by the power of him.
 
 For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon
 all those who have not the law given to them, that they are
 delivered from that awful monster, death and hell, and the devil,
 and the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and
 they are restored to that God who gave them breath, which is the
 Holy One of Israel.
 
 But wo unto him that has the law given, yea, that has all the
 commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them,
 and that wasteth the days of his probation, for awful is his
 state!
 
 O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the vainness, and the
 frailties, and the foolishness of men! When they are learned
 they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel
 of God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves,
 wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not.
 
 And they shall perish.
 
 But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels
 of God.
 
 But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the
 world. For because they are rich they despise the poor, and they
 persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures;
 wherefore, their treasure is their God. And behold, their
 treasure shall perish with them also.
 
 And wo unto the deaf that will not hear; for they shall
 perish.
 
 Wo unto the blind that will not see; for they shall perish
 also.
 
 Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart, for a knowledge of their
 iniquities shall smite them at the last day.
 
 Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell.
 
 Wo unto the murderer who deliberately killeth, for he shall
 die.
 
 Wo unto them who commit whoredoms, for they shall be thrust
 down to hell.
 
 Yea, wo unto those that worship idols, for the devil of all
 devils delighteth in them.
 
 And, in fine, wo unto all those who die in their sins; for
 they shall return to God, and behold his face, and remain in
 their sins.
 
 O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in
 transgressing against that Holy God, and also the awfulness of
 yielding to the enticings of that cunning one. Remember, to be
 carnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life
 eternal.
 
 O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words. Remember the
 greatness of the Holy One of Israel. Do not say that I have
 spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will revile
 against the truth; for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I
 know that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness;
 but the righteous fear them not, for they love the truth and are
 not shaken.
 
 O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy
 One. Remember that his paths are righteous. Behold, the way for
 man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and
 the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he
 employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it
 be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is
 his name.
 
 And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and
 the learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of
 their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches--yea, they are
 they whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things
 away, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in
 the depths of humility, he will not open unto them.
 
 But the things of the wise and the prudent shall be hid from
 them forever--yea, that happiness which is prepared for the
 saints.
 
 O, my beloved brethren, remember my words. Behold, I take
 off my garments, and I shake them before you; I pray the God of
 my salvation that he view me with his all-searching eye;
 wherefore, ye shall know at the last day, when all men shall be
 judged of their works, that the God of Israel did witness that I
 shook your iniquities from my soul, and that I stand with
 brightness before him, and am rid of your blood.
 
 O, my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off
 the chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God
 who is the rock of your salvation.
 
 Prepare your souls for that glorious day when justice shall
 be administered unto the righteous, even the day of judgment,
 that ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not remember
 your awful guilt in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim:
 Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God Almighty--but I know my
 guilt; I transgressed thy law, and my transgressions are mine;
 and the devil hath obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful
 misery.
 
 But behold, my brethren, is it expedient that I should awake
 you to an awful reality of these things? Would I harrow up your
 souls if your minds were pure? Would I be plain unto you
 according to the plainness of the truth if ye were freed from
 sin?
 
 Behold, if ye were holy I would speak unto you of holiness;
 but as ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher, it must
 needs be expedient that I teach you the consequences of sin.
 
 Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, and my heart delighteth in
 righteousness; and I will praise the holy name of my God.
 
 Come, my brethren, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
 waters; and he that hath no money, come buy and eat; yea, come
 buy wine and milk without money and without price.
 
 Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth,
 nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently
 unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come
 unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth
 not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in
 fatness.
 
 Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God;
 pray unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy
 name by night. Let your hearts rejoice.
 
 And behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how great
 his condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his
 greatness, and his grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that
 our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh,
 but that he would preserve them; and in future generations they
 shall become a righteous branch unto the house of Israel.
 
 And now, my brethren, I would speak unto you more; but on the
 morrow I will declare unto you the remainder of my words. Amen.
 
 
 And now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren,
 concerning this righteous branch of which I have spoken.
 
 For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises
 unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown
 unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh
 because of unbelief, nevertheless, God will be merciful unto
 many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to
 that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.
 
 Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that
 Christ--for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this
 should be his name--should come among the Jews, among those who
 are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify
 him--for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other
 nation on earth that would crucify their God.
 
 For should the mighty miracles be wrought among other nations
 they would repent, and know that he be their God.
 
 But because of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem
 will stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified.
 
 Wherefore, because of their iniquities, destructions, famines,
 pestilences, and bloodshed shall come upon them; and they who
 shall not be destroyed shall be scattered among all nations.
 
 But behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that
 they shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I
 covenanted with their fathers that they shall be restored in the
 flesh, upon the earth, unto the lands of their inheritance.
 
 And it shall come to pass that they shall be gathered in from
 their long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the
 four parts of the earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be
 great in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them forth to the
 lands of their inheritance.
 
 Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto
 them, and their queens shall become nursing mothers; wherefore,
 the promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath
 spoken it, and who can dispute?
 
 But behold, this land, said God, shall be a land of thine
 inheritance, and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land.
 
 And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles,
 and there shall be no kings upon the land, who shall raise up
 unto the Gentiles.
 
 And I will fortify this land against all other nations.
 
 And he that fighteth against Zion shall perish, saith God.
 
 For he that raiseth up a king against me shall perish, for I,
 the Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a
 light unto them forever, that hear my words.
 
 Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled
 which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto
 them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret
 works of darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.
 
 Wherefore, he that fighteth against Zion, both Jew and
 Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female, shall perish;
 for they are they who are the whore of all the earth; for they
 who are not for me are against me, saith our God.
 
 For I will fulfil my promises which I have made unto the
 children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the
 flesh--
 
 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our God: I will
 afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I
 will soften the hearts of the Gentiles, that they shall be like
 unto a father to them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall be blessed
 and numbered among the house of Israel.
 
 Wherefore, I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and
 them who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever, for the land
 of their inheritance; for it is a choice land, saith God unto me,
 above all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell
 thereon that they shall worship me, saith God.
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God
 has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us
 remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our
 heads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been driven
 out of the land of our inheritance; but we have been led to a
 better land, for the Lord has made the sea our path, and we are
 upon an isle of the sea.
 
 But great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon
 the isles of the sea; wherefore as it says isles, there must
 needs be more than this, and they are inhabited also by our
 brethren.
 
 For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from
 the house of Israel, according to his will and pleasure. And now
 behold, the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off,
 wherefore he remembereth us also.
 
 Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are
 free to act for yourselves--to choose the way of everlasting
 death or the way of eternal life.
 
 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, reconcile yourselves to the
 will of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; and
 remember, after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in
 and through the grace of God that ye are saved.
 
 Wherefore, may God raise you from death by the power of the
 resurrection, and also from everlasting death by the power of the
 atonement, that ye may be received into the eternal kingdom of
 God, that ye may praise him through grace divine. Amen.
 
 
 And now, Jacob spake many more things to my people at that
 time; nevertheless only these things have I caused to be written,
 for the things which I have written sufficeth me.
 
 And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my
 soul delighteth in his words. For I will liken his words unto my
 people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he
 verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him.
 
 And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him;
 wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to
 prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words
 of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless,
 God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.
 
 Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth
 of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses
 been given; and all things which have been given of God from the
 beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.
 
 And also my soul delighteth in the covenants of the Lord which
 he hath made to our fathers; yea, my soul delighteth in his
 grace, and in his justice, and power, and mercy in the great and
 eternal plan of deliverance from death.
 
 And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save
 Christ should come all men must perish.
 
 For if there be no Christ there be no God; and if there be no
 God we are not, for there could have been no creation. But there
 is a God, and he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his
 own time.
 
 And now I write some of the words of Isaiah, that whoso of my
 people shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice
 for all men. Now these are the words, and ye may liken them unto
 you and unto all men.
 
 
 The word that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah
 and Jerusalem:
 
 And it shall come to pass in the last days, when the mountain
 of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the
 mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations
 shall flow unto it.
 
 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to
 the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and
 he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for
 out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from
 Jerusalem.
 
 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
 people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and
 their spears into pruning-hooks--nation shall not lift up sword
 against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
 
 O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the
 Lord; yea, come, for ye have all gone astray, every one to his
 wicked ways.
 
 Therefore, O Lord, thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of
 Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and hearken
 unto soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves
 in the children of strangers.
 
 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there
 any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses,
 neither is there any end of their chariots.
 
 Their land is also full of idols; they worship the work of
 their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
 
 And the mean man boweth not down, and the great man humbleth
 himself not, therefore, forgive him not.
 
 O ye wicked ones, enter into the rock, and hide thee in the
 dust, for the fear of the Lord and the glory of his majesty shall
 smite thee.
 
 And it shall come to pass that the lofty looks of man shall
 be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and
 the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.
 
 For the day of the Lord of Hosts soon cometh upon all
 nations, yea, upon every one; yea, upon the proud and lofty, and
 upon every one who is lifted up, and he shall be brought low.
 
 Yea, and the day of the Lord shall come upon all the cedars
 of Lebanon, for they are high and lifted up; and upon all the
 oaks of Bashan;
 
 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills, and
 upon all the nations which are lifted up, and upon every people;
 
 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall;
 
 And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of
 Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.
 
 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
 haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be
 exalted in that day.
 
 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.
 
 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
 caves of the earth, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them
 and the glory of his majesty shall smite them, when he ariseth to
 shake terribly the earth.
 
 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his
 idols of gold, which he hath made for himself to worship, to the
 moles and to the bats;
 
 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the
 ragged rocks, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and
 the majesty of his glory shall smite them, when he ariseth to
 shake terribly the earth.
 
 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for
 wherein is he to be accounted of?
 
 
 For behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, doth take away from
 Jerusalem, and from Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole
 staff of bread, and the whole stay of water--
 
 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
 prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient;
 
 The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the
 counselor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.
 
 And I will give children unto them to be their princes, and
 babes shall rule over them.
 
 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and
 every one by his neighbor; the child shall behave himself proudly
 against the ancient, and the base against the honorable.
 
 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
 father, and shall say: Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and
 let not this ruin come under thy hand--
 
 In that day shall he swear, saying: I will not be a healer;
 for in my house there is neither bread nor clothing; make me not
 a ruler of the people.
 
 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because their
 tongues and their doings have been against the Lord, to provoke
 the eyes of his glory.
 
 The show of their countenance doth witness against them, and
 doth declare their sin to be even as Sodom, and they cannot hide
 it. Wo unto their souls, for they have rewarded evil unto
 themselves!
 
 Say unto the righteous that it is well with them; for they
 shall eat the fruit of their doings.
 
 Wo unto the wicked, for they shall perish; for the reward of
 their hands shall be upon them!
 
 And my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule
 over them. O my people, they who lead thee cause thee to err and
 destroy the way of thy paths.
 
 The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the
 people.
 
 The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
 people and the princes thereof; for ye have eaten up the vineyard
 and the spoil of the poor in your houses.
 
 What mean ye? Ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
 faces of the poor, saith the Lord God of Hosts.
 
 Moreover, the Lord saith: Because the daughters of Zion are
 haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes,
 walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their
 feet--
 
 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the
 head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their
 secret parts.
 
 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
 tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round tires like the moon;
 
 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers;
 
 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the
 headbands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings;
 
 The rings, and nose jewels;
 
 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
 wimples, and the crisping-pins;
 
 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the veils.
 
 And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall
 be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well
 set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of
 sackcloth; burning instead of beauty.
 
 Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war.
 
 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be
 desolate, and shall sit upon the ground.
 
 
 And in that day, seven women shall take hold of one man,
 saying: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only
 let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach.
 
 In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and
 glorious; the fruit of the earth excellent and comely to them
 that are escaped of Israel.
 
 And it shall come to pass, they that are left in Zion and
 remain in Jerusalem shall be called holy, every one that is
 written among the living in Jerusalem--
 
 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the
 daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem
 from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the
 spirit of burning.
 
 And the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of mount
 Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the
 shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory of
 Zion shall be a defence.
 
 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
 from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and a covert from storm
 and from rain.
 
 
 And then will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved,
 touching his vineyard. My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very
 fruitful hill.
 
 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
 planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst
 of it, and also made a wine-press therein; and he looked that it
 should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
 
 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
 I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.
 
 What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not
 done in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth
 grapes it brought forth wild grapes.
 
 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my
 vineyard--I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be
 eaten up; and I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be
 trodden down;
 
 And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor digged;
 but there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command
 the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
 
 For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel,
 and the men of Judah his pleasant plant; and he looked for
 judgment, and behold, oppression; for righteousness, but behold,
 a cry.
 
 Wo unto them that join house to house, till there can be no
 place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!
 
 In mine ears, said the Lord of Hosts, of a truth many houses
 shall be desolate, and great and fair cities without inhabitant.
 
 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed
 of a homer shall yield an ephah.
 
 Wo unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
 follow strong drink, that continue until night, and wine inflame
 them!
 
 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine
 are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of the Lord,
 neither consider the operation of his hands.
 
 Therefore, my people are gone into captivity, because they
 have no knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and
 their multitude dried up with thirst.
 
 Therefore, hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
 without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their
 pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.
 
 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man
 shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled.
 
 But the Lord of Hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God
 that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.
 
 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste
 places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.
 
 Wo unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin
 as it were with a cart rope;
 
 That say: Let him make speed, hasten his work, that we may
 see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh
 and come, that we may know it.
 
 Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put
 darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for
 sweet, and sweet for bitter!
 
 Wo unto the wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own
 sight!
 
 Wo unto the mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to
 mingle strong drink;
 
 Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
 righteousness of the righteous from him!
 
 Therefore, as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
 consumeth the chaff, their root shall be rottenness, and their
 blossoms shall go up as dust; because they have cast away the law
 of the Lord of Hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of
 Israel.
 
 Therefore, is the anger of the Lord kindled against his
 people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and
 hath smitten them; and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses
 were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is
 not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
 
 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and
 will hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and behold, they
 shall come with speed swiftly; none shall be weary nor stumble
 among them.
 
 None shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of
 their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken;
 
 Whose arrows shall be sharp, and all their bows bent, and
 their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels
 like a whirlwind, their roaring like a lion.
 
 They shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and
 lay hold of the prey, and shall carry away safe, and none shall
 deliver.
 
 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring
 of the sea; and if they look unto the land, behold, darkness and
 sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.
 
 
 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting
 upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the
 temple.
 
 Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with
 twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
 and with twain he did fly.
 
 And one cried unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is the
 Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.
 
 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
 cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
 
 Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone; because I am a
 man of unclean lips; and I dwell in the midst of a people of
 unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of
 Hosts.
 
 Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in
 his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
 
 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said: Lo, this has touched
 thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
 
 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send,
 and who will go for us? Then I said: Here am I; send me.
 
 And he said: Go and tell this people--Hear ye indeed, but they
 understood not; and see ye indeed, but they perceived not.
 
 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
 and shut their eyes--lest they see with their eyes, and hear with
 their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and
 be healed.
 
 Then said I: Lord, how long? And he said: Until the cities
 be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the
 land be utterly desolate;
 
 And the Lord have removed men far away, for there shall be a
 great forsaking in the midst of the land.
 
 But yet there shall be a tenth, and they shall return, and
 shall be eaten, as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is
 in them when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be
 the substance thereof.
 
 
 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the
 son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin, king of Syria, and
 Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward
 Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
 
 And it was told the house of David, saying: Syria is
 confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart
 of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
 
 Then said the Lord unto Isaiah: Go forth now to meet Ahaz,
 thou and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the
 upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;
 
 And say unto him: Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither
 be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands,
 for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
 Remaliah.
 
 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken
 evil counsel against thee, saying:
 
 Let us go up against Judah and vex it, and let us make a
 breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, yea,
 the son of Tabeal.
 
 Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, neither shall it
 come to pass.
 
 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus,
 Rezin; and within three score and five years shall Ephraim be
 broken that it be not a people.
 
 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
 Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe surely ye shall not be
 established.
 
 Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying:
 
 Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the
 depths, or in the heights above.
 
 But Ahaz said: I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
 
 And he said: Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a small
 thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
 
 Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign--Behold, a
 virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and shall call his
 name Immanuel.
 
 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
 evil and to choose the good.
 
 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose
 the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both
 her kings.
 
 The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon
 thy father's house, days that have not come from the day that
 Ephraim departed from Judah, the king of Assyria.
 
 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall
 hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of Egypt, and for
 the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
 
 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the
 desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all
 thorns, and upon all bushes.
 
 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is
 hired, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the
 head, and the hair of the feet; and it shall also consume the
 beard.
 
 And it shall come to pass in that day, a man shall nourish a
 young cow and two sheep;
 
 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk they
 shall give he shall eat butter; for butter and honey shall every
 one eat that is left in the land.
 
 And it shall come to pass in that day, every place shall be,
 where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings,
 which shall be for briers and thorns.
 
 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither, because all
 the land shall become briers and thorns.
 
 And all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
 shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns; but it
 shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and the treading of
 lesser cattle.
 
 
 Moreover, the word of the Lord said unto me: Take thee a great
 roll, and write in it with a man's pen, concerning
 Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
 
 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the
 priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
 
 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived and bare a
 son. Then said the Lord to me: Call his name,
 Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
 
 For behold, the child shall not have knowledge to cry, My
 father, and my mother, before the riches of Damascus and the
 spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
 
 The Lord spake also unto me again, saying:
 
 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
 go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
 
 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the
 waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria
 and all his glory; and he shall come up over all his channels,
 and go over all his banks.
 
 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go
 over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of
 his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
 
 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in
 pieces; and give ear all ye of far countries; gird yourselves,
 and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall
 be broken in pieces.
 
 Take counsel together, and it shall come to naught; speak the
 word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.
 
 For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and
 instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people,
 saying:
 
 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all to whom this people shall
 say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
 
 Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him be your fear,
 and let him be your dread.
 
 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of
 stumbling, and for a rock of offense to both the houses of
 Israel, for a gin and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
 
 And many among them shall stumble and fall, and be broken,
 and be snared, and be taken.
 
 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
 
 And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the
 house of Jacob, and I will look for him.
 
 Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are
 for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, which
 dwelleth in Mount Zion.
 
 And when they shall say unto you: Seek unto them that have
 familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and mutter--should
 not a people seek unto their God for the living to hear from the
 dead?
 
 To the law and to the testimony; and if they speak not
 according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
 
 And they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry; and
 it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry, they shall
 fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look
 upward.
 
 And they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble, and
 darkness, dimness of anguish, and shall be driven to darkness.
 
 
 Nevertheless, the dimness shall not be such as was in her
 vexation, when at first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun,
 and the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more grievously
 afflict by the way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the
 nations.
 
 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light;
 they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
 hath the light shined.
 
 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and increased the joy--they
 joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men
 rejoice when they divide the spoil.
 
 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of
 his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.
 
 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
 garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel
 of fire.
 
 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the
 government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be
 called, Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting
 Father, The Prince of Peace.
 
 Of the increase of government and peace there is no end, upon
 the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to
 establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even
 forever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.
 
 The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon
 Israel.
 
 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the
 inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of
 heart:
 
 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn
 stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into
 cedars.
 
 Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin
 against him, and join his enemies together;
 
 The Syrians before and the Philistines behind; and they shall
 devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not
 turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
 
 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them,
 neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts.
 
 Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail,
 branch and rush in one day.
 
 The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth
 lies, he is the tail.
 
 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they
 that are led of them are destroyed.
 
 Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men,
 neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows; for
 every one of them is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth
 speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
 his hand is stretched out still.
 
 For wickedness burneth as the fire; it shall devour the
 briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the
 forests, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.
 
 Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the land darkened,
 and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall
 spare his brother.
 
 And he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry; and he
 shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied; they
 shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm--
 
 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; they together shall
 be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
 his hand is stretched out still.
 
 
 Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
 grievousness which they have prescribed;
 
 To turn away the needy from judgment, and to take away the
 right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey,
 and that they may rob the fatherless!
 
 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
 desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for
 help? and where will ye leave your glory?
 
 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they
 shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned
 away, but his hand is stretched out still.
 
 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand
 is their indignation.
 
 I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the
 people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spoil,
 and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the
 streets.
 
 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so;
 but in his heart it is to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
 
 For he saith: Are not my princes altogether kings?
 
 Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not
 Samaria as Damascus?
 
 As my hand hath founded the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
 graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
 
 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do
 to Jerusalem and to her idols?
 
 Wherefore it shall come to pass that when the Lord hath
 performed his whole work upon Mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I
 will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria,
 and the glory of his high looks.
 
 For he saith: By the strength of my hand and by my wisdom I
 have done these things; for I am prudent; and I have moved the
 borders of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I
 have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man;
 
 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people;
 and as one gathereth eggs that are left have I gathered all the
 earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the
 mouth, or peeped.
 
 Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
 Shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? As if
 the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as
 if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood!
 
 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, send among his
 fat ones, leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning
 like the burning of a fire.
 
 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
 for a flame, and shall burn and shall devour his thorns and his
 briers in one day;
 
 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his
 fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a
 standard-bearer fainteth.
 
 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
 child may write them.
 
 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
 Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no
 more again stay upon him that smote them, but shall stay upon the
 Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
 
 The remnant shall return, yea, even the remnant of Jacob,
 unto the mighty God.
 
 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
 remnant of them shall return; the consumption decreed shall
 overflow with righteousness.
 
 For the Lord God of Hosts shall make a consumption, even
 determined in all the land.
 
 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God of Hosts: O my people that
 dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian; he shall smite
 thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after
 the manner of Egypt.
 
 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
 and mine anger in their destruction.
 
 And the Lord of Hosts shall stir up a scourge for him
 according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as
 his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner
 of Egypt.
 
 And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall
 be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy
 neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
 
 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he
 hath laid up his carriages.
 
 They are gone over the passage; they have taken up their
 lodging at Geba; Ramath is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
 
 Lift up the voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause it to be heard
 unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.
 
 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather
 themselves to flee.
 
 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day; he shall shake his
 hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of
 Jerusalem.
 
 Behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts shall lop the bough with
 terror; and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down; and the
 haughty shall be humbled.
 
 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forests with iron,
 and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.
 
 
 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and
 a branch shall grow out of his roots.
 
 And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of
 wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
 spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;
 
 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the
 Lord; and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither
 reprove after the hearing of his ears.
 
 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
 with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite the
 earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips
 shall he slay the wicked.
 
 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
 faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
 
 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
 lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and
 fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.
 
 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
 lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
 
 And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
 the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den.
 
 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, for
 the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the
 waters cover the sea.
 
 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
 stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek;
 and his rest shall be glorious.
 
 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set
 his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his
 people which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and
 from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and
 from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
 
 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
 assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
 dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
 
 The envy of Ephraim also shall depart, and the adversaries of
 Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah
 shall not vex Ephraim.
 
 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines
 towards the west; they shall spoil them of the east together;
 they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of
 Ammon shall obey them.
 
 And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
 sea; and with his mighty wind he shall shake his hand over the
 river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go
 over dry shod.
 
 And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people
 which shall be left, from Assyria, like as it was to Israel in
 the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
 
 
 And in that day thou shalt say: O Lord, I will praise thee;
 though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away, and
 thou comfortedst me.
 
 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid;
 for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also has
 become my salvation.
 
 Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
 salvation.
 
 And in that day shall ye say: Praise the Lord, call upon his
 name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his
 name is exalted.
 
 Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is
 known in all the earth.
 
 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the
 Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
 
 
 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.
 
 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice
 unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the
 nobles.
 
 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my
 mighty ones, for mine anger is not upon them that rejoice in my
 highness.
 
 The noise of the multitude in the mountains like as of a great
 people, a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
 together, the Lord of Hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle.
 
 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, yea, the
 Lord, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole
 land.
 
 Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as
 a destruction from the Almighty.
 
 Therefore shall all hands be faint, every man's heart shall
 melt;
 
 And they shall be afraid; pangs and sorrows shall take hold of
 them; they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be
 as flames.
 
 Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and
 fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he shall destroy the
 sinners thereof out of it.
 
 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
 not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going
 forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
 
 And I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for
 their iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,
 and will lay down the haughtiness of the terrible.
 
 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
 than the golden wedge of Ophir.
 
 Therefore, I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall
 remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, and
 in the day of his fierce anger.
 
 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
 taketh up; and they shall every man turn to his own people, and
 flee every one into his own land.
 
 Every one that is proud shall be thrust through; yea, and
 every one that is joined to the wicked shall fall by the sword.
 
 Their children, also shall be dashed to pieces before their
 eyes; their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished.
 
 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall
 not regard silver and gold, nor shall they delight in it.
 
 Their bows shall also dash the young men to pieces, and they
 shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not
 spare children.
 
 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
 Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
 Gomorrah.
 
 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in
 from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch
 tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
 
 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their
 houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell
 there, and satyrs shall dance there.
 
 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their
 desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces; and her
 time is near to come, and her day shall not be prolonged. For I
 will destroy her speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my
 people, but the wicked shall perish.
 
 
 For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
 Israel, and set them in their own land; and the strangers shall
 be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.
 
 And the people shall take them and bring them to their place;
 yea, from far unto the ends of the earth; and they shall return
 to their lands of promise. And the house of Israel shall possess
 them, and the land of the Lord shall be for servants and
 handmaids; and they shall take them captives unto whom they were
 captives; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
 
 And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give
 thee rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard
 bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.
 
 And it shall come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up
 this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: How hath the
 oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!
 
 The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the scepters of
 the rulers.
 
 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he
 that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none
 hindereth.
 
 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet; they break forth
 into singing.
 
 Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and also the cedars of
 Lebanon, saying: Since thou art laid down no feller is come up
 against us.
 
 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy
 coming; it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones
 of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings
 of the nations.
 
 All they shall speak and say unto thee: Art thou also become
 weak as we? Art thou become like unto us?
 
 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave; the noise of thy viols
 is not heard; the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
 thee.
 
 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
 morning! Art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the
 nations!
 
 For thou hast said in thy heart: I will ascend into heaven, I
 will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon
 the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north;
 
 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like
 the Most High.
 
 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the
 pit.
 
 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and shall
 consider thee, and shall say: Is this the man that made the earth
 to tremble, that did shake kingdoms?
 
 And made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
 thereof, and opened not the house of his prisoners?
 
 All the kings of the nations, yea, all of them, lie in glory,
 every one of them in his own house.
 
 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
 and the remnant of those that are slain, thrust through with a
 sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass
 trodden under feet.
 
 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou
 hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people; the seed of
 evil-doers shall never be renowned.
 
 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquities of
 their fathers, that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor
 fill the face of the world with cities.
 
 For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of Hosts, and
 cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew,
 saith the Lord.
 
 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools
 of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction,
 saith the Lord of Hosts.
 
 The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, saying: Surely as I have
 thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so
 shall it stand--
 
 That I will bring the Assyrian in my land, and upon my
 mountains tread him under foot; then shall his yoke depart from
 off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.
 
 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth;
 and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all nations.
 
 For the Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul?
 And his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?
 
 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
 
 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him
 that smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent's root shall
 come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying
 serpent.
 
 And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy
 shall lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine,
 and he shall slay thy remnant.
 
 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art
 dissolved; for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none
 shall be alone in his appointed times.
 
 What shall then answer the messengers of the nations? That
 the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall
 trust in it.
 
 
 Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I
 have written, which have been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For
 behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my
 people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of
 prophesying among the Jews.
 
 For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the
 manner of the Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and
 their doings were doings of abominations.
 
 Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall
 receive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know
 the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according
 to the word which he hath spoken.
 
 Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of
 Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of
 Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto
 all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy. But I
 give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me;
 wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath
 been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my
 father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my
 people, that they may learn.
 
 Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came
 out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the
 Jews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the
 prophets, and there is none other people that understand the
 things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be
 that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.
 
 But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the
 manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at
 Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about;
 and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments
 of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children,
 according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not
 write them.
 
 But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my
 plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless,
 in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men
 shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to
 pass.
 
 Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he
 that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak
 particularly, and confine the words unto mine own people; for I
 know that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last
 days; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for
 their good have I written them.
 
 And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews
 because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from
 generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never
 hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the
 prophets of the Lord.
 
 Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction
 which should come upon them, immediately after my father left
 Jerusalem; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and
 according to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be
 those which are carried away captive into Babylon.
 
 And now this I speak because of the spirit which is in me.
 And notwithstanding they have been carried away they shall return
 again, and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall
 be restored again to the land of their inheritance.
 
 But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and
 when the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea,
 even the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself
 unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of
 their iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the
 stiffness of their necks.
 
 Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is laid in a
 sepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the
 dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe
 on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. Wherefore, my
 soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his
 day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.
 
 And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath
 risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people,
 unto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall
 be destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and
 the people of his church.
 
 Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations;
 yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews
 shall be scattered by other nations.
 
 And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath
 scourged them by other nations for the space of many generations,
 yea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be
 persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the
 atonement, which is infinite for all mankind--and when that day
 shall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the
 Father in his name, with pure hearts and clean hands, and look
 not forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the
 day will come that it must needs be expedient that they should
 believe these things.
 
 And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to
 restore his people from their lost and fallen state. Wherefore,
 he will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the
 children of men.
 
 Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, which
 words shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given
 them for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who
 was rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they
 need not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there
 should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which
 should deceive the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken
 of by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected
 of the Jews.
 
 For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah
 cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left
 Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also
 the word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the
 Son of God.
 
 And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot
 err. And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of
 the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal
 the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents,
 if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise
 up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the
 rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you,
 that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there
 is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus
 Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.
 
 Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me
 that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and
 handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the
 promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never
 perish as long as the earth should stand.
 
 Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to
 generation as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go
 according to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who
 shall possess them shall be judged of them according to the words
 which are written.
 
 For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children,
 and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled
 to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after
 all we can do.
 
 And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of
 Moses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the
 law shall be fulfilled.
 
 For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath
 become dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of
 our faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.
 
 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of
 Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our
 prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may
 look for a remission of their sins.
 
 Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may
 know the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness
 of the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ,
 and know for what end the law was given. And after the law is
 fulfilled in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts
 against him when the law ought to be done away.
 
 And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people;
 wherefore, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot
 misunderstand. And the words which I have spoken shall stand as
 a testimony against you; for they are sufficient to teach any man
 the right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny
 him not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the
 law.
 
 And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to
 believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One
 of Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him
 with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and
 if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.
 
 And, inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the
 performances and ordinances of God until the law shall be
 fulfilled which was given unto Moses.
 
 
 And after Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show
 himself unto you, my children, and my beloved brethren; and the
 words which he shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye
 shall do.
 
 For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many
 generations shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and
 contentions among my people.
 
 And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given
 unto my people of his birth, and also of his death and
 resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the
 wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast
 out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them;
 wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to
 God from the ground against them.
 
 Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the
 day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for
 they shall be as stubble.
 
 And they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of
 the earth shall swallow them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; and
 mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away,
 and buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and
 grind them to powder.
 
 And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings,
 and earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of
 the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they
 shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them,
 saith the Lord of Hosts.
 
 O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the
 slain of my people! For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh
 consumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto
 my God: Thy ways are just.
 
 But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the
 prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with
 steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all
 persecution--behold, they are they which shall not perish.
 
 But the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he
 shall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three
 generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth
 generation shall have passed away in righteousness.
 
 And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction
 cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul,
 I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and
 they sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their
 pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction; for
 because they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness
 rather than light, therefore they must go down to hell.
 
 For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man.
 And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy
 destruction, and this grieveth my soul.
 
 And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that
 Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be
 convinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;
 
 And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in
 him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation,
 kindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and
 wonders, among the children of men according to their faith.
 
 But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days;
 concerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things
 forth unto the children of men.
 
 After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled
 in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea,
 after the Lord God shall have camped against them round about,
 and shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised
 forts against them; and after they shall have been brought down
 low in the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the
 righteous shall be written, and the prayers of the faithful shall
 be heard, and all those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not
 be forgotten.
 
 For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of
 the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and
 their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the
 Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning
 them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall
 whisper out of the dust.
 
 For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things
 which shall be done among them, and they shall be written and
 sealed up in a book, and those who have dwindled in unbelief
 shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God.
 
 Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been
 destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones
 shall be as chaff that passeth away--yea, thus saith the Lord
 God: It shall be at an instant, suddenly--
 
 And it shall come to pass, that those who have dwindled in
 unbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.
 
 And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes,
 and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling
 block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they
 put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto
 themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may
 get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.
 
 And there are many churches built up which cause envyings,
 and strifes, and malice.
 
 And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of
 old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the
 founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and
 works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a
 flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.
 
 For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord
 God worketh not in darkness.
 
 He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the
 world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own
 life that he may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth
 none that they shall not partake of his salvation.
 
 Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me?
 Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye
 ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without
 price.
 
 Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of
 the synagogues, or out of the houses of worship? Behold, I say
 unto you, Nay.
 
 Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his
 salvation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free
 for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should
 persuade all men to repentance.
 
 Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not
 partake of his goodness? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men
 are privileged the one like unto the other, and none are
 forbidden.
 
 He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for,
 behold priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for
 a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the
 world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.
 
 Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the
 Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have
 charity, which charity is love, and except they should have
 charity they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have
 charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.
 
 But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they
 labor for money they shall perish.
 
 And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men should not
 murder; that they should not lie; that they should not steal;
 that they should not take the name of the Lord their God in vain;
 that they should not envy; that they should not have malice; that
 they should not contend one with another; that they should not
 commit whoredoms; and that they should do none of these things;
 for whoso doeth them shall perish.
 
 For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth
 that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth
 nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he
 inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness;
 and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and
 free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all
 are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.
 
 
 But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the
 Gentiles--yea, behold all the nations of the Gentiles and also
 the Jews, both those who shall come upon this land and those who
 shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the
 earth, behold, they will be drunken with iniquity and all manner
 of abominations--
 
 And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord
 of Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great
 noise, and with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of
 devouring fire.
 
 And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress
 her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto
 them, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he
 eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a
 thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh
 and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so
 shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against
 Mount Zion.
 
 For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity, stay yourselves and
 wonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye shall be drunken
 but not with wine, ye shall stagger but not with strong drink.
 
 For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of
 deep sleep. For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have
 rejected the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he
 covered because of your iniquity.
 
 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth
 unto you the words of a book, and they shall be the words of them
 which have slumbered.
 
 And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be
 a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the
 ending thereof.
 
 Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the
 things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the
 wickedness and abominations of the people. Wherefore the book
 shall be kept from them.
 
 But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall
 deliver the words of the book, which are the words of those who
 have slumbered in the dust, and he shall deliver these words unto
 another;
 
 But the words which are sealed he shall not deliver, neither
 shall he deliver the book. For the book shall be sealed by the
 power of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept
 in the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may
 come forth; for behold, they reveal all things from the
 foundation of the world unto the end thereof.
 
 And the day cometh that the words of the book which were
 sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read
 by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the
 children of men which ever have been among the children of men,
 and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.
 
 Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto
 the man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the
 eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it
 be that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God,
 besides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall
 testify to the truth of the book and the things therein.
 
 And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few
 according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto
 the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of
 the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words
 of the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him
 good will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that
 rejecteth the word of God!
 
 But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say
 unto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words
 which are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may
 show them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee. And
 the learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read
 them.
 
 And now, because of the glory of the world and to get gain
 will they say this, and not for the glory of God.
 
 And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is
 sealed.
 
 Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.
 
 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will
 deliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not
 learned; and the man that is not learned shall say: I am not
 learned.
 
 Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not
 read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine
 own work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give
 unto thee.
 
 Touch not the things which are sealed, for I will bring them
 forth in mine own due time; for I will show unto the children of
 men that I am able to do mine own work.
 
 Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have
 commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised
 unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up
 unto me, that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read,
 until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things
 unto the children of men.
 
 For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will
 show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and
 forever; and I work not among the children of men save it be
 according to their faith.
 
 And again it shall come to pass that the Lord shall say unto
 him that shall read the words that shall be delivered him:
 
 Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth,
 and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts
 far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts
 of men--
 
 Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this
 people, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of
 their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of
 their prudent shall be hid.
 
 And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from
 the Lord! And their works are in the dark; and they say: Who
 seeth us, and who knoweth us? And they also say: Surely, your
 turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's
 clay. But behold, I will show unto them, saith the Lord of
 Hosts, that I know all their works. For shall the work say of
 him that made it, he made me not? Or shall the thing framed say
 of him that framed it, he had no understanding?
 
 But behold, saith the Lord of Hosts: I will show unto the
 children of men that it is yet a very little while and Lebanon
 shall be turned into a fruitful field; and the fruitful field
 shall be esteemed as a forest.
 
 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book,
 and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of
 darkness.
 
 And the meek also shall increase, and their joy shall be in
 the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of
 Israel.
 
 For assuredly as the Lord liveth they shall see that the
 terrible one is brought to naught, and the scorner is consumed,
 and all that watch for iniquity are cut off;
 
 And they that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a
 snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just
 for a thing of naught.
 
 Therefore, thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham,
 concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
 neither shall his face now wax pale.
 
 But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the
 midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy
 One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.
 
 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,
 and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
 
 
 And now, behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you,
 according as the Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I know
 that they must surely come to pass.
 
 And the things which shall be written out of the book shall be
 of great worth unto the children of men, and especially unto our
 seed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel.
 
 For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which
 are built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto
 the other: Behold, I, I am the Lord's; and the others shall say:
 I, I am the Lord's; and thus shall every one say that hath built
 up churches, and not unto the Lord--
 
 And they shall contend one with another; and their priests
 shall contend one with another, and they shall teach with their
 learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance.
 
 And they deny the power of God, the Holy One of Israel; and
 they say unto the people: Hearken unto us, and hear ye our
 precept; for behold there is no God today, for the Lord and the
 Redeemer hath done his work, and he hath given his power unto
 men;
 
 Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they shall say there is
 a miracle wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for
 this day he is not a God of miracles; he hath done his work.
 
 Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and
 be merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.
 
 And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and
 be merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a
 little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because
 of his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in
 this; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so
 be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and
 at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.
 
 Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this
 manner, false and vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed
 up in their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels
 from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark.
 
 And the blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against
 them.
 
 Yea, they have all gone out of the way; they have become
 corrupted.
 
 Because of pride, and because of false teachers, and false
 doctrine, their churches have become corrupted, and their
 churches are lifted up; because of pride they are puffed up.
 
 They rob the poor because of their fine sanctuaries; they rob
 the poor because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the
 meek and the poor in heart, because in their pride they are
 puffed up.
 
 They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and because of
 pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have
 all gone astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of
 Christ; nevertheless, they are led, that in many instances they
 do err because they are taught by the precepts of men.
 
 O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up
 in the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false
 doctrines, and all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the
 right way of the Lord, wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord
 God Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell!
 
 Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught
 and revile against that which is good, and say that is of no
 worth! For the day shall come that the Lord God will speedily
 visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are
 fully ripe in iniquity they shall perish.
 
 But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of
 their wickedness and abominations they shall not be destroyed,
 saith the Lord of Hosts.
 
 But behold, that great and abominable church, the whore of
 all the earth, must tumble to the earth, and great must be the
 fall thereof.
 
 For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which
 belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the
 devil will grasp them with his everlasting chains, and they be
 stirred up to anger, and perish;
 
 For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the
 children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is
 good.
 
 And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal
 security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion
 prospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls,
 and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.
 
 And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there
 is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is
 none--and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them
 with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.
 
 Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and
 hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must
 stand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their
 works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them,
 even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.
 
 Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!
 
 Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!
 
 Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men,
 and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!
 
 Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need
 no more!
 
 And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and are angry
 because of the truth of God! For behold, he that is built upon
 the rock receiveth it with gladness; and he that is built upon a
 sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall.
 
 Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of
 God, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough!
 
 For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the
 children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a
 little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto
 my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall
 learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and
 from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be
 taken away even that which they have.
 
 Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh
 his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their
 precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.
 
 Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith the Lord God of Hosts! For
 notwithstanding I shall lengthen out mine arm unto them from day
 to day, they will deny me; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto
 them, saith the Lord God, if they will repent and come unto me;
 for mine arm is lengthened out all the day long, saith the Lord
 God of Hosts.
 
 
 But behold, there shall be many--at that day when I shall
 proceed to do a marvelous work among them, that I may remember my
 covenants which I have made unto the children of men, that I may
 set my hand again the second time to recover my people, which are
 of the house of Israel;
 
 And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made
 unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember
 your seed; and that the words of your seed should proceed forth
 out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth
 unto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which
 are of the house of Israel;
 
 And because my words shall hiss forth--many of the Gentiles
 shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there
 cannot be any more Bible.
 
 But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible;
 and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant
 people. And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they
 receive from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they
 remember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews,
 and their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the
 Gentiles?
 
 O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient
 covenant people? Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated
 them, and have not sought to recover them. But behold, I will
 return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have
 not forgotten my people.
 
 Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and
 we need no more Bible. Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by
 the Jews?
 
 Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not
 that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I
 remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule
 in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth
 my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations
 of the earth?
 
 Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my
 word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness
 unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto
 another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like
 unto another. And when the two nations shall run together the
 testimony of the two nations shall run together also.
 
 And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same
 yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words
 according to mine own pleasure. And because that I have spoken
 one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my
 work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of
 man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.
 
 Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose
 that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I
 have not caused more to be written.
 
 For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and
 in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea,
 that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out
 of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every
 man according to their works, according to that which is written.
 
 For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write
 it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write
 it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of
 Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I
 shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall
 write it.
 
 And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words
 of the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the
 Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the
 lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have
 the words of the Nephites and the Jews.
 
 And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the
 house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their
 possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one. And I
 will show unto them that fight against my word and against my
 people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I
 covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.
 
 
 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you;
 for I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye should suppose that ye are
 more righteous than the Gentiles shall be. For behold, except ye
 shall keep the commandments of God ye shall all likewise perish;
 and because of the words which have been spoken ye need not
 suppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.
 
 For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as
 will repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of
 the Jews as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord
 covenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and
 believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.
 
 And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews
 and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken
 shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up
 again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the
 words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the
 remnant of our seed.
 
 And then shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how
 that we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of
 the Jews.
 
 And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them;
 wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their
 fathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had
 among their fathers.
 
 And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a
 blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of
 darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many
 generations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a
 pure and delightsome people.
 
 And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered
 also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to
 gather in upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe
 in Christ shall also become a delightsome people.
 
 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his
 work among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring
 about the restoration of his people upon the earth.
 
 And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and
 reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. And he shall
 smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of
 his lips shall he slay the wicked.
 
 For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a
 great division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy;
 and he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must
 destroy the wicked by fire.
 
 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
 faithfulness the girdle of his reins.
 
 And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard
 shall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion,
 and the fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them.
 
 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
 lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
 
 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
 the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den.
 
 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for
 the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the
 waters cover the sea.
 
 Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known;
 yea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men.
 
 There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed;
 there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in
 the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth
 save it shall be loosed.
 
 Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the
 children of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall
 have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a
 long time. And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my
 sayings.
 
 
 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my
 beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I
 know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of
 the words of my brother Jacob.
 
 Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save
 it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of
 Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to
 the plainness of my prophesying.
 
 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner
 doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord
 God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men
 according to their language, unto their understanding.
 
 Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken
 unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me,
 that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the
 sins of the world.
 
 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need
 to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how
 much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even
 by water!
 
 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the
 Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by
 water?
 
 Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being
 holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the
 flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto
 the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his
 commandments.
 
 Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost
 descended upon him in the form of a dove.
 
 And again, it showeth unto the children of men the
 straightness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by
 which they should enter, he having set the example before them.
 
 And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me.
 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall
 be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?
 
 And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in
 the name of my Beloved Son.
 
 And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that
 is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy
 Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things
 which ye have seen me do.
 
 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall
 follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy
 and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of
 your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take
 upon you the name of Christ, by baptism--yea, by following your
 Lord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word,
 behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh
 the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak
 with the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of
 Israel.
 
 But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the
 Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and
 witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my
 commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the
 baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new
 tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this
 should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not
 known me.
 
 And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words
 of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the
 end, the same shall be saved.
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a
 man shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son
 of the living God, he cannot be saved.
 
 Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen
 that your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause
 have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by
 which ye should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is
 repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of
 your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.
 
 And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to
 eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done
 according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye
 have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and
 the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made,
 that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this
 strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I
 say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by
 the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly
 upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.
 
 Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in
 Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God
 and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting
 upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus
 saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.
 
 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and
 there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man
 can be saved in the kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the
 doctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father,
 and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without
 end. Amen.
 
 
 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder
 somewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after
 ye have entered in by the way. But, behold, why do ye ponder
 these things in your hearts?
 
 Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had
 received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels?
 
 And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it
 were by the Holy Ghost?
 
 Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they
 speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast
 upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will
 tell you all things what ye should do.
 
 Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot
 understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye
 knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must
 perish in the dark.
 
 For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by
 the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all
 things what ye should do.
 
 Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no
 more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto
 you in the flesh. And when he shall manifest himself unto you in
 the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye
 observe to do.
 
 And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine
 utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and
 the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of
 men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great
 knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain
 as word can be.
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still
 in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning
 this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which
 teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the
 evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he
 must not pray.
 
 But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not
 faint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in
 the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of
 Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that
 thy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.
 
 
 And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were
 taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto
 speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost
 the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the
 children of men.
 
 But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against
 the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they
 cast many things away which are written and esteem them as things
 of naught.
 
 But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem
 it as of great worth, and especially unto my people. For I pray
 continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by
 night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I
 know that he will hear my cry.
 
 And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for
 the gain of my people. And the words which I have written in
 weakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to
 do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it
 speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to
 endure to the end, which is life eternal.
 
 And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the
 plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the
 words which I have written save he shall be of the spirit of the
 devil.
 
 I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus,
 for he hath redeemed my soul from hell.
 
 I have charity for my people, and great faith in Christ that I
 shall meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.
 
 I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean them
 from whence I came.
 
 I also have charity for the Gentiles. But behold, for none of
 these can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and
 enter into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which
 leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day
 of probation.
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends
 of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and
 if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye
 shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they
 are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they
 teach all men that they should do good.
 
 And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye--for Christ
 will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his
 words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face
 before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of
 him to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.
 
 And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us,
 if not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last
 day.
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house
 of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the
 voice of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day
 shall come.
 
 And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and
 respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words
 which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God,
 behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall
 condemn you at the last day.
 
 For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the
 judgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must
 obey. Amen.
 
 Jacob
 THE BOOK OF JACOB
 THE BROTHER OF NEPHI
 The words of his preaching unto his brethren. He confoundeth a
 man who seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ. A few words
 concerning the history of the people of Nephi.
 
 
 For behold, it came to pass that fifty and five years had
 passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore,
 Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates,
 upon which these things are engraven.
 
 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon
 these plates a few of the things which I consider to be most
 precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly,
 concerning the history of this people which are called the people
 of Nephi.
 
 For he said that the history of his people should be engraven
 upon his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates
 and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.
 
 And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation
 which was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the heads
 of them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were
 possible, for Christ's sake, and for the sake of our people.
 
 For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made
 manifest unto us concerning our people, what things should happen
 unto them.
 
 And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much
 prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ and his kingdom, which
 should come.
 
 Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we
 might persuade them to come unto Christ, and partake of the
 goodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any
 means he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as
 in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children
 of Israel were in the wilderness.
 
 Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not
 to rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men
 would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross
 and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it
 upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.
 
 Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die;
 wherefore, he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his
 people now, according to the reigns of the kings.
 
 The people having loved Nephi exceedingly, he having been a
 great protector for them, having wielded the sword of Laban in
 their defence, and having labored in all his days for their
 welfare--
 
 Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance
 his name. And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the
 people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the
 reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let
 them be of whatever name they would.
 
 And it came to pass that Nephi died.
 
 Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites;
 nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites,
 Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.
 
 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these
 names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the
 people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call
 Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the
 kings.
 
 And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the
 reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and
 indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like
 unto David of old desiring many wives and concubines, and also
 Solomon, his son.
 
 Yea, and they also began to search much gold and silver, and
 began to be lifted up somewhat in pride.
 
 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught
 them in the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the
 Lord.
 
 For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated
 priests and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.
 
 And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us
 the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own
 heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all
 diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood
 might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would
 come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the
 last day.
 
 
 The words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi, spake unto the
 people of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:
 
 Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the
 responsibility which I am under to God, to magnify mine office
 with soberness, and that I might rid my garments of your sins, I
 come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you
 the word of God.
 
 And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been diligent in
 the office of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with
 much more desire and anxiety for the welfare of your souls than I
 have hitherto been.
 
 For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the
 Lord, which I have given unto you.
 
 But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of
 the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth I can tell you
 concerning your thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in
 sin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and
 abominable unto God.
 
 Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame
 before the presence of my Maker, that I must testify unto you
 concerning the wickedness of your hearts.
 
 And also it grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of
 speech concerning you, before your wives and your children, many
 of whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate
 before God, which thing is pleasing unto God;
 
 And it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the
 pleasing word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded
 soul.
 
 Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained,
 because of the strict commandment which I have received from God,
 to admonish you according to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds
 of those who are already wounded, instead of consoling and
 healing their wounds; and those who have not been wounded,
 instead of feasting upon the pleasing word of God have daggers
 placed to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds.
 
 But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do
 according to the strict commands of God, and tell you concerning
 your wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in
 heart, and the broken heart, and under the glance of the piercing
 eye of the Almighty God.
 
 Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the
 plainness of the word of God. For behold, as I inquired of the
 Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying: Jacob, get thou up
 into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall
 give thee unto this people.
 
 And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare
 unto you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for
 silver, and for all manner of precious ores, in the which this
 land, which is a land of promise unto you and to your seed, doth
 abound most plentifully.
 
 And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most
 pleasingly, that you have obtained many riches; and because some
 of you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren
 ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff
 necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel,
 and persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better
 than they.
 
 And now, my brethren, do ye suppose that God justifieth you
 in this thing? Behold, I say unto you, Nay. But he condemneth
 you, and if ye persist in these things his judgments must
 speedily come unto you.
 
 O that he would show you that he can pierce you, and with one
 glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust!
 
 O that he would rid you from this iniquity and abomination.
 And, O that ye would listen unto the word of his commands, and
 let not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls!
 
 Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar
 with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like
 unto you.
 
 But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of
 God.
 
 And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain
 riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to
 do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to
 liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the
 afflicted.
 
 And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you concerning
 pride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and
 persecuted him because ye were proud in your hearts, of the
 things which God hath given you, what say ye of it?
 
 Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him
 who created all flesh? And the one being is as precious in his
 sight as the other. And all flesh is of the dust; and for the
 selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his
 commandments and glorify him forever.
 
 And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this
 pride. And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a
 grosser crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly because of you.
 
 But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser
 crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to
 wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they
 seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the
 things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.
 
 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and
 concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.
 
 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth
 out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I
 might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the
 loins of Joseph.
 
 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people
 shall do like unto them of old.
 
 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of
 the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be
 one wife; and concubines he shall have none;
 
 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And
 whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of
 Hosts.
 
 Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the
 Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.
 
 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto
 me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto
 these things.
 
 For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the
 mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem,
 yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness
 and abominations of their husbands.
 
 And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the
 cries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out
 of the land of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men
 of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts.
 
 For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my
 people because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with
 a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit
 whoredoms, like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.
 
 And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments
 were given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them
 before; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have
 done these things which ye ought not to have done.
 
 Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites,
 our brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives,
 and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad
 examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up
 to God against you. And because of the strictness of the word of
 God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced
 with deep wounds.
 
 
 But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in
 heart. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him
 with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your
 afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down justice
 upon those who seek your destruction.
 
 O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and
 receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye
 may, if your minds are firm, forever.
 
 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are
 filthy this day before God; for except ye repent the land is
 cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy
 like unto you, nevertheless they are cursed with a sore cursing,
 shall scourge you even unto destruction.
 
 And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall
 possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead
 away the righteous out from among you.
 
 Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of
 their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their
 skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten
 the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our
 father--that they should have save it were one wife, and
 concubines they should have none, and there should not be
 whoredoms committed among them.
 
 And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore,
 because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord
 God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and
 one day they shall become a blessed people.
 
 Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love
 their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their
 children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is
 because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much
 better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?
 
 O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins
 that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be
 brought with them before the throne of God.
 
 Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of
 God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness
 of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of
 their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and
 remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.
 
 Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have
 grieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set
 before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your
 filthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins
 be heaped upon your heads at the last day.
 
 O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of
 your souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber
 of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may
 not become angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire
 and brimstone which is the second death.
 
 And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of
 Nephi, warning them against fornication and lasciviousness, and
 every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them.
 
 And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which
 now began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these plates;
 but many of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates,
 and their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their
 kings.
 
 These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were
 made by the hand of Nephi. And I make an end of speaking these
 words.
 
 
 Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered
 much unto my people in word, (and I cannot write but a little of
 my words, because of the difficulty of engraving our words upon
 plates) and we know that the things which we write upon plates
 must remain;
 
 But whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon
 plates must perish and vanish away; but we can write a few words
 upon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved
 brethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or
 concerning their fathers--
 
 Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to
 engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved
 brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts,
 and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with
 sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first parents.
 
 For, for this intent have we written these things, that they
 may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory
 many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves
 had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which
 were before us.
 
 Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in
 his name, and also we worship the Father in his name. And for
 this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to
 him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for
 righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the
 wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up
 his son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and his Only Begotten
 Son.
 
 Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many
 revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these
 witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken,
 insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the
 very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.
 
 Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may
 know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto
 the children of men, that we have power to do these things.
 
 Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How
 unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is
 impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man
 knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore,
 brethren, despise not the revelations of God.
 
 For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of
 the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word.
 Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to
 speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the
 earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it,
 according to his will and pleasure?
 
 Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to
 take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that
 he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over
 all his works.
 
 Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through
 the atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain
 a resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which
 is in Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto
 God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him
 before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.
 
 And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things;
 for why not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a
 perfect knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a
 resurrection and the world to come?
 
 Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to
 the understanding of men; for the Spirit speaketh the truth and
 lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are,
 and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are
 manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls. But
 behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also
 spake them unto prophets of old.
 
 But behold, the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they
 despised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and
 sought for things that they could not understand. Wherefore,
 because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking
 beyond the mark, they must needs fall; for God hath taken away
 his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things
 which they cannot understand, because they desired it. And
 because they desired it God hath done it, that they may stumble.
 
 And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying;
 for I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that
 by the stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon
 which they might build and have safe foundation.
 
 But behold, according to the scriptures, this stone shall
 become the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation,
 upon which the Jews can build.
 
 And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after
 having rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that
 it may become the head of their corner?
 
 Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this mystery unto
 you; if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in
 the Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you.
 
 
 Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words
 of the prophet Zenos, which he spake unto the house of Israel,
 saying:
 
 Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the words of me, a
 prophet of the Lord.
 
 For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O house of
 Israel, like unto a tame olive-tree, which a man took and
 nourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began
 to decay.
 
 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went
 forth, and he saw that his olive-tree began to decay; and he
 said: I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that
 perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it
 perish not.
 
 And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it,
 and nourished it according to his word.
 
 And it came to pass that after many days it began to put forth
 somewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the
 main top thereof began to perish.
 
 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it,
 and he said unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose
 this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild
 olive-tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off
 those main branches which are beginning to wither away, and we
 will cast them into the fire that they may be burned.
 
 And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many
 of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them
 whithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that
 the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit
 thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and
 tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.
 
 Take thou the branches of the wild olive-tree, and graft them
 in, in the stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off I
 will cast into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber
 the ground of my vineyard.
 
 And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the
 vineyard did according to the word of the Lord of the vineyard,
 and grafted in the branches of the wild olive-tree.
 
 And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged
 about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It
 grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps
 I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I
 might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing.
 
 Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and nourish it,
 according to my words.
 
 And these will I place in the nethermost part of my vineyard,
 whithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; and I do it
 that I may preserve unto myself the natural branches of the tree;
 and also, that I may lay up fruit thereof against the season,
 unto myself; for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree and
 the fruit thereof.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went his
 way, and hid the natural branches of the tame olive-tree in the
 nethermost parts of the vineyard, some in one and some in
 another, according to his will and pleasure.
 
 And it came to pass that a long time passed away, and the
 Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down
 into the vineyard, that we may labor in the vineyard.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and also
 the servant, went down into the vineyard to labor. And it came
 to pass that the servant said unto his master: Behold, look here;
 behold the tree.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and
 beheld the tree in the which the wild olive branches had been
 grafted; and it had sprung forth and begun to bear fruit. And he
 beheld that it was good; and the fruit thereof was like unto the
 natural fruit.
 
 And he said unto the servant: Behold, the branches of the
 wild tree have taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof,
 that the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and
 because of the much strength of the root thereof the wild
 branches have brought forth tame fruit. Now, if we had not
 grafted in these branches, the tree thereof would have perished.
 And now, behold, I shall lay up much fruit, which the tree
 thereof hath brought forth; and the fruit thereof I shall lay up
 against the season, unto mine own self.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto
 the servant: Come, let us go to the nethermost part of the
 vineyard, and behold if the natural branches of the tree have not
 brought forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of the fruit
 thereof against the season, unto mine own self.
 
 And it came to pass that they went forth whither the master
 had hid the natural branches of the tree, and he said unto the
 servant: Behold these; and he beheld the first that it had
 brought forth much fruit; and he beheld also that it was good.
 And he said unto the servant: Take of the fruit thereof, and lay
 it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own
 self; for behold, said he, this long time have I nourished it,
 and it hath brought forth much fruit.
 
 And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master:
 How comest thou hither to plant this tree, or this branch of the
 tree? For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy
 vineyard.
 
 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him: Counsel me not; I
 knew that it was a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto
 thee, I have nourished it this long time, and thou beholdest that
 it hath brought forth much fruit.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto
 his servant: Look hither; behold I have planted another branch of
 the tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was
 poorer than the first. But, behold the tree. I have nourished
 it this long time, and it hath brought forth much fruit;
 therefore, gather it, and lay it up against the season, that I
 may preserve it unto mine own self.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said again
 unto his servant: Look hither, and behold another branch also,
 which I have planted; behold that I have nourished it also, and
 it hath brought forth fruit.
 
 And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the
 last. Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and
 I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree
 hath brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree
 hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree
 like unto the others.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto
 the servant: Pluck off the branches that have not brought forth
 good fruit, and cast them into the fire.
 
 But behold, the servant said unto him: Let us prune it, and
 dig about it, and nourish it a little longer, that perhaps it may
 bring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up
 against the season.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the
 servant of the Lord of the vineyard did nourish all the fruit of
 the vineyard.
 
 And it came to pass that a long time had passed away, and the
 Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down
 into the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard. For
 behold, the time draweth near, and the end soon cometh;
 wherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own
 self.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the
 servant went down into the vineyard; and they came to the tree
 whose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches
 had been grafted in; and behold all sorts of fruit did cumber the
 tree.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard did taste
 of the fruit, every sort according to its number. And the Lord
 of the vineyard said: Behold, this long time have we nourished
 this tree, and I have laid up unto myself against the season much
 fruit.
 
 But behold, this time it hath brought forth much fruit, and
 there is none of it which is good. And behold, there are all
 kinds of bad fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding
 all our labor; and now it grieveth me that I should lose this
 tree.
 
 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: What
 shall we do unto the tree, that I may preserve again good fruit
 thereof unto mine own self?
 
 And the servant said unto his master: Behold, because thou
 didst graft in the branches of the wild olive-tree they have
 nourished the roots, that they are alive and they have not
 perished; wherefore thou beholdest that they are yet good.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto
 his servant: The tree profiteth me nothing, and the roots thereof
 profit me nothing so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit.
 
 Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good, and for mine
 own purpose I have preserved them; and because of their much
 strength they have hitherto brought forth, from the wild
 branches, good fruit.
 
 But behold, the wild branches have grown and have overrun the
 roots thereof; and because that the wild branches have overcome
 the roots thereof it hath brought forth much evil fruit; and
 because that it hath brought forth so much evil fruit thou
 beholdest that it beginneth to perish; and it will soon become
 ripened, that it may be cast into the fire, except we should do
 something for it to preserve it.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto
 his servant: Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the
 vineyard, and behold if the natural branches have also brought
 forth evil fruit.
 
 And it came to pass that they went down into the nethermost
 parts of the vineyard. And it came to pass that they beheld that
 the fruit of the natural branches had become corrupt also; yea,
 the first and the second and also the last; and they had all
 become corrupt.
 
 And the wild fruit of the last had overcome that part of the
 tree which brought forth good fruit, even that the branch had
 withered away and died.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and
 said unto the servant: What could I have done more for my
 vineyard?
 
 Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it
 were these, had become corrupted. And now these which have once
 brought forth good fruit have also become corrupted; and now all
 the trees of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to be
 hewn down and cast into the fire.
 
 And behold this last, whose branch hath withered away, I did
 plant in a good spot of ground; yea, even that which was choice
 unto me above all other parts of the land of my vineyard.
 
 And thou beheldest that I also cut down that which cumbered
 this spot of ground, that I might plant this tree in the stead
 thereof.
 
 And thou beheldest that a part thereof brought forth good
 fruit, and a part thereof brought forth wild fruit; and because I
 plucked not the branches thereof and cast them into the fire,
 behold, they have overcome the good branch that it hath withered
 away.
 
 And now, behold, notwithstanding all the care which we have
 taken of my vineyard, the trees thereof have become corrupted,
 that they bring forth no good fruit; and these I had hoped to
 preserve, to have laid up fruit thereof against the season, unto
 mine own self. But, behold, they have become like unto the wild
 olive-tree, and they are of no worth but to be hewn down and cast
 into the fire; and it grieveth me that I should lose them.
 
 But what could I have done more in my vineyard? Have I
 slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it, Nay, I have
 nourished it, and I have digged about it, and I have pruned it,
 and I have dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost
 all the day long, and the end draweth nigh. And it grieveth me
 that I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast
 them into the fire that they should be burned. Who is it that
 has corrupted my vineyard?
 
 And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Is
 it not the loftiness of thy vineyard--have not the branches
 thereof overcome the roots which are good? And because the
 branches have overcome the roots thereof, behold they grew faster
 than the strength of the roots, taking strength unto themselves.
 Behold, I say, is not this the cause that the trees of thy
 vineyard have become corrupted?
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto
 the servant: Let us go to and hew down the trees of the vineyard
 and cast them into the fire, that they shall not cumber the
 ground of my vineyard, for I have done all. What could I have
 done more for my vineyard?
 
 But, behold, the servant said unto the Lord of the vineyard:
 Spare it a little longer.
 
 And the Lord said: Yea, I will spare it a little longer, for
 it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard.
 
 Wherefore, let us take of the branches of these which I have
 planted in the nethermost parts of my vineyard, and let us graft
 them into the tree from whence they came; and let us pluck from
 the tree those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in
 the natural branches of the tree in the stead thereof.
 
 And this will I do that the tree may not perish, that,
 perhaps, I may preserve unto myself the roots thereof for mine
 own purpose.
 
 And, behold, the roots of the natural branches of the tree
 which I planted whithersoever I would are yet alive; wherefore,
 that I may preserve them also for mine own purpose, I will take
 of the branches of this tree, and I will graft them in unto them.
 
 Yea, I will graft in unto them the branches of their mother tree,
 that I may preserve the roots also unto mine own self, that when
 they shall be sufficiently strong perhaps they may bring forth
 good fruit unto me, and I may yet have glory in the fruit of my
 vineyard.
 
 And it came to pass that they took from the natural tree
 which had become wild, and grafted in unto the natural trees,
 which also had become wild.
 
 And they also took of the natural trees which had become
 wild, and grafted into their mother tree.
 
 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck not
 the wild branches from the trees, save it be those which are most
 bitter; and in them ye shall graft according to that which I have
 said.
 
 And we will nourish again the trees of the vineyard, and we
 will trim up the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the
 trees those branches which are ripened, that must perish, and
 cast them into the fire.
 
 And this I do that, perhaps, the roots thereof may take
 strength because of their goodness; and because of the change of
 the branches, that the good may overcome the evil.
 
 And because that I have preserved the natural branches and
 the roots thereof, and that I have grafted in the natural
 branches again into their mother tree, and have preserved the
 roots of their mother tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my
 vineyard may bring forth again good fruit; and that I may have
 joy again in the fruit of my vineyard, and, perhaps, that I may
 rejoice exceedingly that I have preserved the roots and the
 branches of the first fruit--
 
 Wherefore, go to, and call servants, that we may labor
 diligently with our might in the vineyard, that we may prepare
 the way, that I may bring forth again the natural fruit, which
 natural fruit is good and the most precious above all other
 fruit.
 
 Wherefore, let us go to and labor with our might this last
 time, for behold the end draweth nigh, and this is for the last
 time that I shall prune my vineyard.
 
 Graft in the branches; begin at the last that they may be
 first, and that the first may be last, and dig about the trees,
 both old and young, the first and the last; and the last and the
 first, that all may be nourished once again for the last time.
 
 Wherefore, dig about them, and prune them, and dung them once
 more, for the last time, for the end draweth nigh. And if it be
 so that these last grafts shall grow, and bring forth the natural
 fruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that they may
 grow.
 
 And as they begin to grow ye shall clear away the branches
 which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the
 good and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad
 thereof all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong
 for the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish, and I lose the
 trees of my vineyard.
 
 For it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my
 vineyard; wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the
 good shall grow, that the root and the top may be equal in
 strength, until the good shall overcome the bad, and the bad be
 hewn down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not the ground
 of my vineyard; and thus will I sweep away the bad out of my
 vineyard.
 
 And the branches of the natural tree will I graft in again
 into the natural tree;
 
 And the branches of the natural tree will I graft into the
 natural branches of the tree; and thus will I bring them together
 again, that they shall bring forth the natural fruit, and they
 shall be one.
 
 And the bad shall be cast away, yea, even out of all the land
 of my vineyard; for behold, only this once will I prune my
 vineyard.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his
 servant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded
 him, and brought other servants; and they were few.
 
 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor
 in the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the last
 time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at
 hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your
 might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up
 unto myself against the time which will soon come.
 
 And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with
 their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with
 them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the
 vineyard in all things.
 
 And there began to be the natural fruit again in the
 vineyard; and the natural branches began to grow and thrive
 exceedingly; and the wild branches began to be plucked off and to
 be cast away; and they did keep the root and the top thereof
 equal, according to the strength thereof.
 
 And thus they labored, with all diligence, according to the
 commandments of the Lord of the vineyard, even until the bad had
 been cast away out of the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved
 unto himself that the trees had become again the natural fruit;
 and they became like unto one body; and the fruits were equal;
 and the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto himself the
 natural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the
 beginning.
 
 And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw
 that his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more
 corrupt, he called up his servants, and said unto them: Behold,
 for this last time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou
 beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have
 preserved the natural fruit, that it is good, even like as it was
 in the beginning. And blessed art thou; for because ye have been
 diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my
 commandments, and have brought unto me again the natural fruit,
 that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away,
 behold ye shall have joy with me because of the fruit of my
 vineyard.
 
 For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of my
 vineyard unto mine own self against the season, which speedily
 cometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and
 pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I will lay
 up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to
 that which I have spoken.
 
 And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come
 into my vineyard, then will I cause the good and the bad to be
 gathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad
 will I cast away into its own place. And then cometh the season
 and the end; and my vineyard will I cause to be burned with fire.
 
 
 And now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you that I would
 prophesy, behold, this is my prophecy--that the things which this
 prophet Zenos spake, concerning the house of Israel, in the which
 he likened them unto a tame olive-tree, must surely come to pass.
 
 And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time
 to recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that
 the servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish
 and prune his vineyard; and after that the end soon cometh.
 
 And how blessed are they who have labored diligently in his
 vineyard; and how cursed are they who shall be cast out into
 their own place! And the world shall be burned with fire.
 
 And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the
 house of Israel, both roots and branches; and he stretches forth
 his hands unto them all the day long; and they are a stiffnecked
 and a gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their
 hearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God.
 
 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of
 soberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of
 heart, and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you. And while
 his arm of mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day,
 harden not your hearts.
 
 Yea, today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts;
 for why will ye die?
 
 For behold, after ye have been nourished by the good word of
 God all the day long, will ye bring forth evil fruit, that ye
 must be hewn down and cast into the fire?
 
 Behold, will ye reject these words? Will ye reject the words
 of the prophets; and will ye reject all the words which have been
 spoken concerning Christ, after so many have spoken concerning
 him; and deny the good word of Christ, and the power of God, and
 the gift of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit, and make
 a mock of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid for
 you?
 
 Know ye not that if ye will do these things, that the power of
 the redemption and the resurrection, which is in Christ, will
 bring you to stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of
 God?
 
 And according to the power of justice, for justice cannot be
 denied, ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone,
 whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up
 forever and ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is endless
 torment.
 
 O then, my beloved brethren, repent ye, and enter in at the
 strait gate, and continue in the way which is narrow, until ye
 shall obtain eternal life.
 
 O be wise; what can I say more?
 
 Finally, I bid you farewell, until I shall meet you before
 the pleasing bar of God, which bar striketh the wicked with awful
 dread and fear. Amen.
 
 
 And now it came to pass after some years had passed away,
 there came a man among the people of Nephi, whose name was
 Sherem.
 
 And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people,
 and to declare unto them that there should be no Christ. And he
 preached many things which were flattering unto the people; and
 this he did that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.
 
 And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts
 of the people, insomuch that he did lead away many hearts; and he
 knowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he
 sought much opportunity that he might come unto me.
 
 And he was learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the
 language of the people; wherefore, he could use much flattery,
 and much power of speech, according to the power of the devil.
 
 And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding
 the many revelations and the many things which I had seen
 concerning these things; for I truly had seen angels, and they
 had ministered unto me. And also, I had heard the voice of the
 Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore,
 I could not be shaken.
 
 And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did
 he speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much
 opportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and
 also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye
 call the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.
 
 And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the
 right way of God, and keep not the law of Moses which is the
 right way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a
 being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence. And now
 behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is blasphemy; for
 no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot tell of things to
 come. And after this manner did Sherem contend against me.
 
 But behold, the Lord God poured in his Spirit into my soul,
 insomuch that I did confound him in all his words.
 
 And I said unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who shall come?
 And he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him;
 but I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever
 will be.
 
 And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures? And he
 said, Yea.
 
 And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they
 truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto you that none of the
 prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken
 concerning this Christ.
 
 And this is not all--it has been made manifest unto me, for I
 have heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me
 by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should
 be no atonement made all mankind must be lost.
 
 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Show me a sign by
 this power of the Holy Ghost, in the which ye know so much.
 
 And I said unto him: What am I that I should tempt God to
 show unto thee a sign in the thing which thou knowest to be true?
 
 Yet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the devil.
 Nevertheless, not my will be done; but if God shall smite thee,
 let that be a sign unto thee that he has power, both in heaven
 and in earth; and also, that Christ shall come. And thy will, O
 Lord, be done, and not mine.
 
 And it came to pass that when I, Jacob, had spoken these
 words, the power of the Lord came upon him, insomuch that he fell
 to the earth. And it came to pass that he was nourished for the
 space of many days.
 
 And it came to pass that he said unto the people: Gather
 together on the morrow, for I shall die; wherefore, I desire to
 speak unto the people before I shall die.
 
 And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were
 gathered together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied the
 things which he had taught them, and confessed the Christ, and
 the power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels.
 
 And he spake plainly unto them, that he had been deceived by
 the power of the devil. And he spake of hell, and of eternity,
 and of eternal punishment.
 
 And he said: I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable
 sin, for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said
 that I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him.
 And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case
 shall be awful; but I confess unto God.
 
 And it came to pass that when he had said these words he
 could say no more, and he gave up the ghost.
 
 And when the multitude had witnessed that he spake these
 things as he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished
 exceedingly; insomuch that the power of God came down upon them,
 and they were overcome that they fell to the earth.
 
 Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob, for I had
 requested it of my Father who was in heaven; for he had heard my
 cry and answered my prayer.
 
 And it came to pass that peace and the love of God was
 restored again among the people; and they searched the
 scriptures, and hearkened no more to the words of this wicked
 man.
 
 And it came to pass that many means were devised to reclaim
 and restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it
 all was vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they
 had an eternal hatred against us, their brethren. And they
 sought by the power of their arms to destroy us continually.
 
 Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against them with
 their arms, and with all their might, trusting in the God and
 rock of their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet,
 conquerors of their enemies.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the
 record of this people being kept on the other plates of Nephi,
 wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written
 according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time
 passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it
 were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people,
 wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a
 wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and
 contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.
 
 And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave;
 wherefore, I said unto my son Enos: Take these plates. And I
 told him the things which my brother Nephi had commanded me, and
 he promised obedience unto the commands. And I make an end of my
 writing upon these plates, which writing has been small; and to
 the reader I bid farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may
 read my words. Brethren, adieu.
 
 THE BOOK OF ENOS
 
 Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that
 he was a just man--for he taught me in his language, and also in
 the nurture and admonition of the Lord--and blessed be the name
 of my God for it--
 
 And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God,
 before I received a remission of my sins.
 
 Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words
 which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life,
 and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.
 
 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and
 I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own
 soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the
 night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the
 heavens.
 
 And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are
 forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.
 
 And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt
 was swept away.
 
 And I said: Lord, how is it done?
 
 And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou
 hast never before heard nor seen. And many years pass away
 before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to,
 thy faith hath made thee whole.
 
 Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began
 to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites;
 wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.
 
 And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the
 voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit
 thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my
 commandments. I have given unto them this land, and it is a holy
 land; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity;
 wherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said;
 and their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their
 own heads.
 
 And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to
 be unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long
 strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.
 
 And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with
 all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee
 according to thy desires, because of thy faith.
 
 And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of
 him--that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites,
 should fall into transgression, and by any means be destroyed,
 and the Lamanites should not be destroyed, that the Lord God
 would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so
 be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be brought forth
 at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might
 be brought unto salvation--
 
 For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring
 them to the true faith. And they swore in their wrath that, if
 it were possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also
 all the traditions of our fathers.
 
 Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to preserve
 our records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto
 me: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye
 shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.
 
 And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would
 preserve the records; and he covenanted with me that he would
 bring them forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time.
 
 And I, Enos, knew it would be according to the covenant which
 he had made; wherefore my soul did rest.
 
 And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of
 me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their
 faith; for their faith was like unto thine.
 
 And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went about among the
 people of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of
 the things which I had heard and seen.
 
 And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek
 diligently to restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God.
 But our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were
 led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious,
 and a bloodthirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness;
 feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering
 about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their
 loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and
 in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing
 save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to
 destroy us.
 
 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the
 land, and raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of
 herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and
 goats, and wild goats, and also many horses.
 
 And there were exceedingly many prophets among us. And the
 people were a stiffnecked people, hard to understand.
 
 And there was nothing save it was exceeding harshness,
 preaching and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and
 destructions, and continually reminding them of death, and the
 duration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and
 all these things--stirring them up continually to keep them in
 the fear of the Lord. I say there was nothing short of these
 things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep
 them from going down speedily to destruction. And after this
 manner do I write concerning them.
 
 And I saw wars between the Nephites and Lamanites in the
 course of my days.
 
 And it came to pass that I began to be old, and an hundred
 and seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our
 father Lehi left Jerusalem.
 
 And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been
 wrought upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy
 unto this people, and declare the word according to the truth
 which is in Christ. And I have declared it in all my days, and
 have rejoiced in it above that of the world.
 
 And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my
 Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest. And I rejoice in
 the day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand
 before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will
 say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared
 for you in the mansions of my Father. Amen.
 
 THE BOOK OF JAROM
 
 Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words according to the
 commandment of my father, Enos, that our genealogy may be kept.
 
 And as these plates are small, and as these things are written
 for the intent of the benefit of our brethren the Lamanites,
 wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall
 not write the things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations.
 For what could I write more than my fathers have written? For
 have not they revealed the plan of salvation? I say unto you,
 Yea; and this sufficeth me.
 
 Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this
 people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness
 of their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the
 stiffness of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly
 merciful unto them, and has not as yet swept them off from the
 face of the land.
 
 And there are many among us who have many revelations, for
 they are not all stiffnecked. And as many as are not stiffnecked
 and have faith, have communion with the Holy Spirit, which maketh
 manifest unto the children of men, according to their faith.
 
 And now, behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the
 people of Nephi had waxed strong in the land. They observed to
 keep the law of Moses and the sabbath day holy unto the Lord.
 And they profaned not; neither did they blaspheme. And the laws
 of the land were exceedingly strict.
 
 And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and
 the Lamanites also. And they were exceedingly more numerous than
 were they of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink
 the blood of beasts.
 
 And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the
 Nephites, to battle. But our kings and our leaders were mighty
 men in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways
 of the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them
 away out of our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or
 whatsoever place of our inheritance.
 
 And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the
 land, and became exceedingly rich in gold, and in silver, and in
 precious things, and in fine workmanship of wood, in buildings,
 and in machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and
 steel, making all manner of tools of every kind to till the
 ground, and weapons of war--yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the
 quiver, and the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for
 war.
 
 And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not
 prosper against us. But the word of the Lord was verified, which
 he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep
 my commandments ye shall prosper in the land.
 
 And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did
 threaten the people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that
 if they did not keep the commandments, but should fall into
 transgression, they should be destroyed from off the face of the
 land.
 
 Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers,
 did labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the
 people to diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent
 for which it was given; persuading them to look forward unto the
 Messiah, and believe in him to come as though he already was.
 And after this manner did they teach them.
 
 And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from
 being destroyed upon the face of the land; for they did prick
 their hearts with the word, continually stirring them up unto
 repentance.
 
 And it came to pass that two hundred and thirty and eight
 years had passed away--after the manner of wars, and contentions,
 and dissensions, for the space of much of the time.
 
 And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small.
 But behold, my brethren, ye can go to the other plates of Nephi;
 for behold, upon them the records of our wars are engraven,
 according to the writings of the kings, or those which they
 caused to be written.
 
 And I deliver these plates into the hands of my son Omni,
 that they may be kept according to the commandments of my
 fathers.
 
 THE BOOK OF OMNI
 
 Behold, it came to pass that I, Omni, being commanded by my
 father, Jarom, that I should write somewhat upon these plates, to
 preserve our genealogy--
 
 Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should know that I
 fought much with the sword to preserve my people, the Nephites,
 from falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites. But
 behold, I of myself am a wicked man, and I have not kept the
 statutes and the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have
 done.
 
 And it came to pass that two hundred and seventy and six years
 had passed away, and we had many seasons of peace; and we had
 many seasons of serious war and bloodshed. Yea, and in fine, two
 hundred and eighty and two years had passed away, and I had kept
 these plates according to the commandments of my fathers; and I
 conferred them upon my son Amaron. And I make an end.
 
 And now I, Amaron, write the things whatsoever I write, which
 are few, in the book of my father.
 
 Behold, it came to pass that three hundred and twenty years
 had passed away, and the more wicked part of the Nephites were
 destroyed.
 
 For the Lord would not suffer, after he had led them out of
 the land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from falling
 into the hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suffer that
 the words should not be verified, which he spake unto our
 fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my
 commandments ye shall not prosper in the land.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great judgment;
 nevertheless, he did spare the righteous that they should not
 perish, but did deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.
 
 And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my
 brother Chemish.
 
 Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same
 book with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which he wrote,
 that he wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day
 that he delivered them unto me. And after this manner we keep
 the records, for it is according to the commandments of our
 fathers. And I make an end.
 
 Behold, I, Abinadom, am the son of Chemish. Behold, it came
 to pass that I saw much war and contention between my people, the
 Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword, have taken
 the lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my brethren.
 
 And behold, the record of this people is engraven upon plates
 which is had by the kings, according to the generations; and I
 know of no revelation save that which has been written, neither
 prophecy; wherefore, that which is sufficient is written. And I
 make an end.
 
 Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom. Behold, I will
 speak unto you somewhat concerning Mosiah, who was made king over
 the land of Zarahemla; for behold, he being warned of the Lord
 that he should flee out of the land of Nephi, and as many as
 would hearken unto the voice of the Lord should also depart out
 of the land with him, into the wilderness--
 
 And it came to pass that he did according as the Lord had
 commanded him. And they departed out of the land into the
 wilderness, as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord;
 and they were led by many preachings and prophesyings. And they
 were admonished continually by the word of God; and they were led
 by the power of his arm, through the wilderness, until they came
 down into the land which is called the land of Zarahemla.
 
 And they discovered a people, who were called the people of
 Zarahemla. Now, there was great rejoicing among the people of
 Zarahemla; and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because
 the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the plates of brass
 which contained the record of the Jews.
 
 Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah discovered that the
 people of Zarahemla came out from Jerusalem at the time that
 Zedekiah, king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon.
 
 And they journeyed in the wilderness, and were brought by the
 hand of the Lord across the great waters, into the land where
 Mosiah discovered them; and they had dwelt there from that time
 forth.
 
 And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, they had become
 exceedingly numerous. Nevertheless, they had had many wars and
 serious contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to
 time; and their language had become corrupted; and they had
 brought no records with them; and they denied the being of their
 Creator; and Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could understand
 them.
 
 But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be
 taught in his language. And it came to pass that after they were
 taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of
 his fathers, according to his memory; and they are written, but
 not in these plates.
 
 And it came to pass that the people of Zarahemla, and of
 Mosiah, did unite together; and Mosiah was appointed to be their
 king.
 
 And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah, there was a large
 stone brought unto him with engravings on it; and he did
 interpret the engravings by the gift and power of God.
 
 And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of
 his people. And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of
 Zarahemla; and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons.
 
 It also spake a few words concerning his fathers. And his
 first parents came out from the tower, at the time the Lord
 confounded the language of the people; and the severity of the
 Lord fell upon them according to his judgments, which are just;
 and their bones lay scattered in the land northward.
 
 Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I
 have lived to see his death; and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in
 his stead.
 
 And behold, I have seen, in the days of king Benjamin, a
 serious war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the
 Lamanites. But behold, the Nephites did obtain much advantage
 over them; yea, insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of
 the land of Zarahemla.
 
 And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no
 seed, and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord,
 wherefore, I shall deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting
 all men to come unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in
 prophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of
 angels, and in the gift of speaking with tongues, and in the gift
 of interpreting languages, and in all things which are good; for
 there is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord; and
 that which is evil cometh from the devil.
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come
 unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his
 salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him,
 and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue
 in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord
 liveth ye will be saved.
 
 And now I would speak somewhat concerning a certain number
 who went up into the wilderness to return to the land of Nephi;
 for there was a large number who were desirous to possess the
 land of their inheritance.
 
 Wherefore, they went up into the wilderness. And their
 leader being a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man,
 wherefore he caused a contention among them; and they were all
 slain, save fifty, in the wilderness, and they returned again to
 the land of Zarahemla.
 
 And it came to pass that they also took others to a
 considerable number, and took their journey again into the
 wilderness.
 
 And I, Amaleki, had a brother, who also went with them; and I
 have not since known concerning them. And I am about to lie down
 in my grave; and these plates are full. And I make an end of my
 speaking.
 
 THE WORDS OF MORMON
 
 And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which
 I have been making into the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have
 witnessed almost all the destruction of my people, the Nephites.
 
 And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I
 deliver these records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth
 me that he will witness the entire destruction of my people. But
 may God grant that he may survive them, that he may write
 somewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that
 perhaps some day it may profit them.
 
 And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have
 written; for after I had made an abridgment from the plates of
 Nephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki
 spake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into
 my hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small
 account of the prophets, from Jacob down to the reign of this
 king Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi.
 
 And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me,
 because of the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my fathers
 knowing that many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also
 know that as many things as have been prophesied concerning us
 down to this day have been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond
 this day must surely come to pass--
 
 Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon
 them, which remainder of my record I shall take from the plates
 of Nephi; and I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of
 my people.
 
 But behold, I shall take these plates, which contain these
 prophesyings and revelations, and put them with the remainder of
 my record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be
 choice unto my brethren.
 
 And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me,
 according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in
 me. And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all
 things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do
 according to his will.
 
 And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may
 once again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of
 Christ; that they may once again be a delightsome people.
 
 And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my record, which I
 take from the plates of Nephi; and I make it according to the
 knowledge and the understanding which God has given me.
 
 Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki had delivered
 up these plates into the hands of king Benjamin, he took them and
 put them with the other plates, which contained records which had
 been handed down by the kings, from generation to generation
 until the days of king Benjamin.
 
 And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation
 to generation until they have fallen into my hands. And I,
 Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved from this time
 henceforth. And I know that they will be preserved; for there
 are great things written upon them, out of which my people and
 their brethren shall be judged at the great and last day,
 according to the word of God which is written.
 
 And now, concerning this king Benjamin--he had somewhat of
 contentions among his own people.
 
 And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites
 came down out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his people.
 
 But behold, king Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he
 did stand against them; and he did fight with the strength of his
 own arm, with the sword of Laban.
 
 And in the strength of the Lord they did contend against
 their enemies, until they had slain many thousands of the
 Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did contend against the
 Lamanites until they had driven them out of all the lands of
 their inheritance.
 
 And it came to pass that after there had been false Christs,
 and their mouths had been shut, and they punished according to
 their crimes;
 
 And after there had been false prophets, and false preachers
 and teachers among the people, and all these having been punished
 according to their crimes; and after there having been much
 contention and many dissensions away unto the Lamanites, behold,
 it came to pass that king Benjamin, with the assistance of the
 holy prophets who were among his people--
 
 For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and he did reign
 over his people in righteousness; and there were many holy men in
 the land, and they did speak the word of God with power and with
 authority; and they did use much sharpness because of the
 stiffneckedness of the people--
 
 Wherefore, with the help of these, king Benjamin, by laboring
 with all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul,
 and also the prophets, did once more establish peace in the land.
 
 Mosiah
 THE BOOK OF MOSIAH
 
 
 And now there was no more contention in all the land of
 Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benjamin, so
 that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his
 days.
 
 And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called
 their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that
 they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that
 thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they
 might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the
 mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of
 the Lord.
 
 And he also taught them concerning the records which were
 engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye
 should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain
 these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in
 ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries
 of God.
 
 For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have
 remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children,
 except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been
 taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read
 these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby
 they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the
 commandments of God, even down to this present time.
 
 I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which
 have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might
 read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments
 always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled
 in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the
 Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do
 not believe them when they are taught them, because of the
 traditions of their fathers, which are not correct.
 
 O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings
 are true, and also that these records are true. And behold, also
 the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of
 our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they
 are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them
 before our eyes.
 
 And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search
 them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye
 should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the
 land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our
 fathers.
 
 And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which
 are not written in this book.
 
 And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end
 of teaching his sons, that he waxed old, and he saw that he must
 very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it
 expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.
 
 Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are
 the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that
 ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all
 this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah
 who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered
 together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people
 out of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this
 people, whom the Lord our God hath given us.
 
 And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that thereby
 they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God
 hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because
 they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of
 the Lord.
 
 And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out,
 except it be through transgression.
 
 Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored
 people of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a
 wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them
 up, that thereby they become weak like unto their brethren; and
 he will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous
 power, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers.
 
 For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in
 the preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the
 hands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred.
 
 And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end
 of these sayings to his son, that he gave him charge concerning
 all the affairs of the kingdom.
 
 And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records
 which were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the plates
 of Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director,
 which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared
 by the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one
 according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him.
 
 Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor
 progress in their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the
 displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten
 with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance
 of their duty.
 
 And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his
 father had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the people who
 were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather
 themselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words
 which his father should speak unto them.
 
 
 And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father
 had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the
 land, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all
 the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words
 which king Benjamin should speak unto them.
 
 And there were a great number, even so many that they did not
 number them; for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great
 in the land.
 
 And they also took of the firstlings of their flocks, that
 they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the
 law of Moses;
 
 And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God,
 who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had
 delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had
 appointed just men to be their teachers, and also a just man to
 be their king, who had established peace in the land of
 Zarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the commandments of
 God, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God
 and all men.
 
 And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they
 pitched their tents round about, every man according to his
 family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters,
 and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the
 youngest, every family being separate one from another.
 
 And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man
 having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that
 thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which
 king Benjamin should speak unto them;
 
 For the multitude being so great that king Benjamin could not
 teach them all within the walls of the temple, therefore he
 caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear
 the words which he should speak unto them.
 
 And it came to pass that he began to speak to his people from
 the tower; and they could not all hear his words because of the
 greatness of the multitude; therefore he caused that the words
 which he spake should be written and sent forth among those that
 were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also
 receive his words.
 
 And these are the words which he spake and caused to be
 written, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled
 yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall
 speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up
 hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you
 should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and
 your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the
 mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.
 
 I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should
 fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a
 mortal man.
 
 But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of
 infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this
 people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the
 hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this
 people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power,
 to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord
 hath granted unto me.
 
 I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days
 in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold
 nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;
 
 Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in
 dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that
 ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor
 even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of
 wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the
 commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded
 you--
 
 And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I
 might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and
 that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be
 borne--and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves
 are witnesses this day.
 
 Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might
 boast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse
 you; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can
 answer a clear conscience before God this day.
 
 Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I
 had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for
 I have only been in the service of God.
 
 And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom;
 that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow
 beings ye are only in the service of your God.
 
 Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call
 your king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to
 serve one another?
 
 And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king, who has spent
 his days in your service, and yet has been in the service of God,
 do merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your
 heavenly King!
 
 I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all
 the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess,
 to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you,
 and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye
 should live in peace one with another--
 
 I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created
 you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by
 lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to
 your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to
 another--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls
 yet ye would be unprofitable servants.
 
 And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his
 commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his
 commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth
 vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his
 commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.
 
 And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted
 unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.
 
 And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath
 commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you;
 and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto
 him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what
 have ye to boast?
 
 And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I answer you,
 Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the
 earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold,
 it belongeth to him who created you.
 
 And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye
 yourselves are; for I am also of the dust. And ye behold that I
 am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother
 earth.
 
 Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking
 with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have
 caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might
 be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me,
 when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he
 hath commanded me concerning you.
 
 I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble
 yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood,
 at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave,
 that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join
 the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.
 
 And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye
 should assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto
 you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;
 
 For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble
 exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God
 doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto
 you, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this
 day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.
 
 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have
 hitherto done. As ye have kept my commandments, and also the
 commandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept
 from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall
 keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which
 shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land,
 and your enemies shall have no power over you.
 
 But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions
 among you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken
 of by my father Mosiah.
 
 For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to
 obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth
 and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own
 soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment,
 having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.
 
 I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it
 be your little children that have not been taught concerning
 these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to
 your heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are;
 and also have been taught concerning the records which contain
 the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even
 down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;
 
 And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now.
 And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the
 Lord; therefore, they are just and true.
 
 And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have
 known and have been taught all these things, if ye should
 transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye
 do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may
 have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may
 be blessed, prospered, and preserved--
 
 I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh
 out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey
 the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness;
 therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in
 unholy temples.
 
 Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth
 an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his
 immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth
 cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill
 his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an
 unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.
 
 And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man;
 therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.
 
 O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little
 children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly
 unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to
 a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen
 into transgression.
 
 And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the
 blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of
 God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal
 and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are
 received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a
 state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these
 things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
 
 
 And again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have
 somewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to
 tell you concerning that which is to come.
 
 And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me
 by an angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke,
 and behold he stood before me.
 
 And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall
 tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad
 tidings of great joy.
 
 For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy
 righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou
 mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people,
 that they may also be filled with joy.
 
 For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with
 power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all
 eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the
 children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and
 shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as
 healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the
 blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing
 all manner of diseases.
 
 And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell
 in the hearts of the children of men.
 
 And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger,
 thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be
 unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great
 shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of
 his people.
 
 And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the
 Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the
 beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.
 
 And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto
 the children of men even through faith on his name; and even
 after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he
 hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.
 
 And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he
 standeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are
 done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of
 men.
 
 For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those
 who have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not
 knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly
 sinned.
 
 But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against
 God! For salvation cometh to none such except it be through
 repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.
 
 And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the
 children of men, to declare these things to every kindred,
 nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that
 Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their
 sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he
 had already come among them.
 
 Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked
 people, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.
 
 And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he
 unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake
 unto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their
 hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing
 except it were through the atonement of his blood.
 
 And even if it were possible that little children could sin
 they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for
 behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of
 Christ atoneth for their sins.
 
 And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other
 name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come
 unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ,
 the Lord Omnipotent.
 
 For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the
 infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink
 damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and
 become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and
 is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ,
 the Lord Omnipotent.
 
 For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the
 fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to
 the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man
 and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord,
 and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full
 of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit
 to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.
 
 And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come when
 the knowledge of the Savior shall spread throughout every nation,
 kindred, tongue, and people.
 
 And behold, when that time cometh, none shall be found
 blameless before God, except it be little children, only through
 repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent.
 
 And even at this time, when thou shalt have taught thy people
 the things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, even then
 are they found no more blameless in the sight of God, only
 according to the words which I have spoken unto thee.
 
 And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath
 commanded me.
 
 And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright
 testimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof they
 shall be judged, every man according to his works, whether they
 be good, or whether they be evil.
 
 And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful view of
 their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink
 from the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless
 torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have
 drunk damnation to their own souls.
 
 Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of
 God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could
 deny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the
 forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have claim on them no
 more forever.
 
 And their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose
 flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and
 ever. Thus hath the Lord commanded me. Amen.
 
 
 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an
 end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by
 the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the
 multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear
 of the Lord had come upon them.
 
 And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even
 less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with
 one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of
 Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our
 hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son
 of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall
 come down among the children of men.
 
 And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the
 Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy,
 having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of
 conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in
 Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king
 Benjamin had spoken unto them.
 
 And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak
 unto them, saying: My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my
 people, I would again call your attention, that ye may hear and
 understand the remainder of my words which I shall speak unto
 you.
 
 For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this
 time has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your
 worthless and fallen state--
 
 I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness
 of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his
 patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and
 also, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation
 of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that
 should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in
 keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the
 end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body--
 
 I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through
 the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world
 for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who
 are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.
 
 And this is the means whereby salvation cometh. And there is
 none other salvation save this which hath been spoken of; neither
 are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the
 conditions which I have told you.
 
 Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all
 things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all
 wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that
 man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can
 comprehend.
 
 And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and
 forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in
 sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you
 believe all these things see that ye do them.
 
 And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye
 have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have
 known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have
 received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly
 great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember,
 and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your
 own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you,
 unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of
 humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing
 steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was
 spoken by the mouth of the angel.
 
 And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always
 rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a
 remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the
 glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which
 is just and true.
 
 And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to
 live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that
 which is his due.
 
 And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or
 naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of
 God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil,
 who is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which hath
 been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all
 righteousness.
 
 But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and
 soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve
 one another.
 
 And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need
 of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him
 that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar
 putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to
 perish.
 
 Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his
 misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him
 of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not
 suffer, for his punishments are just--
 
 But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath
 great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he
 hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the
 kingdom of God.
 
 For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend
 upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we
 have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver,
 and for all the riches which we have of every kind?
 
 And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his
 name, and begging for a remission of your sins. And has he
 suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his
 Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled
 with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that
 ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.
 
 And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are
 dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth
 grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith,
 believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart
 of the substance that ye have one to another.
 
 And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you
 for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much
 more just will be your condemnation for withholding your
 substance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also
 your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of
 the thing which thou hast done.
 
 I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall
 perish with him; and now, I say these things unto those who are
 rich as pertaining to the things of this world.
 
 And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have
 sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who
 deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your
 hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would
 give.
 
 And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless,
 otherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye
 covet that which ye have not received.
 
 And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken
 unto you--that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your
 sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God--I
 would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every
 man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry,
 clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their
 relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their
 wants.
 
 And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order;
 for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has
 strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent,
 that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must
 be done in order.
 
 And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you
 borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he
 borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit
 sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin
 also.
 
 And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may
 commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many
 that I cannot number them.
 
 But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch
 yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds,
 and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of
 what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto
 the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember,
 and perish not.
 
 
 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus
 spoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his
 people if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.
 
 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all
 the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of
 their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord
 Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our
 hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do
 good continually.
 
 And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God,
 and the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that
 which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all
 things.
 
 And it is the faith which we have had on the things which our
 king has spoken unto us that has brought us to this great
 knowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such exceedingly great joy.
 
 And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do
 his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things
 that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we
 may not bring upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as has been
 spoken by the angel, that we may not drink out of the cup of the
 wrath of God.
 
 And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of
 them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words
 that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a
 righteous covenant.
 
 And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall
 be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters;
 for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say
 that your hearts are changed through faith on his name;
 therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his
 daughters.
 
 And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other
 head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given
 whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take
 upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the
 covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your
 lives.
 
 And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be
 found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by
 which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.
 
 And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take
 upon him the name of Christ must be called by some other name;
 therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God.
 
 And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the
 name that I said I should give unto you that never should be
 blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take
 heed that ye do not transgress, that the name be not blotted out
 of your hearts.
 
 I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the
 name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the
 left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye
 shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.
 
 For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and
 who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and
 intents of his heart?
 
 And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his
 neighbor, and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; he will not even
 suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him
 away, and cast him out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be
 among you if ye know not the name by which ye are called.
 
 Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable,
 always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God
 Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven,
 that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through
 the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created
 all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all. Amen.
 
 
 And now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having
 finished speaking to the people, that he should take the names of
 all those who had entered into a covenant with God to keep his
 commandments.
 
 And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it
 were little children, but who had entered into the covenant and
 had taken upon them the name of Christ.
 
 And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an
 end of all these things, and had consecrated his son Mosiah to be
 a ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the
 charges concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to
 teach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the
 commandments of God, and to stir them up in remembrance of the
 oath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they
 returned, every one, according to their families, to their own
 houses.
 
 And Mosiah began to reign in his father's stead. And he began
 to reign in the thirtieth year of his age, making in the whole,
 about four hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi
 left Jerusalem.
 
 And king Benjamin lived three years and he died.
 
 And it came to pass that king Mosiah did walk in the ways of
 the Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did
 keep his commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him.
 
 And king Mosiah did cause his people that they should till the
 earth. And he also, himself, did till the earth, that thereby he
 might not become burdensome to his people, that he might do
 according to that which his father had done in all things. And
 there was no contention among all his people for the space of
 three years.
 
 
 And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had
 continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to
 know concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of
 Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had
 heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of
 Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.
 
 And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted that sixteen of
 their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi to inquire
 concerning their brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that on the morrow they started to go up,
 having with them one Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man, and
 a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.
 
 And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the
 wilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore they
 wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they
 wander.
 
 And when they had wandered forty days they came to a hill,
 which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched
 their tents.
 
 And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were
 Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of
 Nephi.
 
 And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the
 land of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were
 surrounded by the king's guard, and were taken, and were bound,
 and were committed to prison.
 
 And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they
 were again brought before the king, and their bands were loosed;
 and they stood before the king, and were permitted, or rather
 commanded, that they should answer the questions which he should
 ask them.
 
 And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah,
 who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of
 Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their
 fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people.
 
 And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold
 as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with
 my guards without the gate?
 
 And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be
 preserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have
 caused that my guards should have put you to death. Ye are
 permitted to speak.
 
 And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he
 went forth and bowed himself before the king; and rising again he
 said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am
 yet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to
 speak with boldness;
 
 For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have
 suffered that I should have worn these bands. For I am Ammon,
 and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the
 land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff
 brought up out of that land.
 
 And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words
 of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a
 surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet
 alive. And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause
 that my people shall rejoice also.
 
 For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed
 with a tax which is grievous to be borne. And now, behold, our
 brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands
 of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better
 that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king
 of the Lamanites.
 
 And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no
 more bind Ammon nor his brethren, but caused that they should go
 to the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren
 into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest
 themselves from the labors of their journey; for they had
 suffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and
 fatigue.
 
 And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a
 proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather
 themselves together to the temple to hear the words which he
 should speak unto them.
 
 And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves
 together that he spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my
 people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, the time
 is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in
 subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings,
 which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual
 struggle to be made.
 
 Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your
 trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac,
 and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel
 out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk
 through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that
 they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did
 he do for them.
 
 And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the
 land of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even
 until now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and
 abominations that he has brought us into bondage.
 
 And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made
 king over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land
 of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and
 craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with
 king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions
 of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the
 city of Shilom; and the land round about--
 
 And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this
 people into subjection or into bondage. And behold, we at this
 time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount
 of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain
 of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our
 herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of
 the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.
 
 And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this,
 our affliction, great? Now behold, how great reason we have to
 mourn.
 
 Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to
 mourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and
 their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.
 
 For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord
 would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon
 them. But behold, they would not hearken unto his words; but
 there arose contentions among them, even so much that they did
 shed blood among themselves.
 
 And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man
 of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and
 prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming
 of Christ.
 
 And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the
 Father of all things, and said that he should take upon him the
 image of man, and it should be the image after which man was
 created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was
 created after the image of God, and that God should come down
 among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and
 go forth upon the face of the earth--
 
 And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and
 many more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God
 upon them. Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage,
 and that they are smitten with sore afflictions?
 
 For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people
 in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways
 that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling
 block before them.
 
 And again, he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they
 shall reap the chaff thereof in the whirlwind; and the effect
 thereof is poison.
 
 And again he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they
 shall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction.
 
 And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye
 are smitten and afflicted.
 
 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart,
 and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of
 mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and
 pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.
 
 
 And it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of
 speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and
 only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his
 people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the
 land of Zarahemla.
 
 And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude,
 and rehearse unto them all that had happened unto their brethren
 from the time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the
 time that he himself came up out of the land.
 
 And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king
 Benjamin had taught them, and explained them to the people of
 king Limhi, so that they might understand all the words which he
 spake.
 
 And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king
 Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return
 every one unto his own house.
 
 And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which
 contained the record of his people from the time that they left
 the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he
 might read them.
 
 Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired
 of him to know if he could interpret languages, and Ammon told
 him that he could not.
 
 And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions
 of my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should
 take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find
 the land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to
 deliver us out of bondage.
 
 And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many
 days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla
 but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many
 waters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of
 men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings
 of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled
 with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.
 
 And for a testimony that the things that they had said are
 true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with
 engravings, and they are of pure gold.
 
 And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are
 large, and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly
 sound.
 
 And again, they have brought swords, the hilts thereof have
 perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust; and
 there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the
 language or the engravings that are on the plates. Therefore I
 said unto thee: Canst thou translate?
 
 And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can
 translate? For I am desirous that these records should be
 translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a
 knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed,
 from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a
 knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am
 desirous to know the cause of their destruction.
 
 Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king,
 of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith
 that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient
 date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called
 interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded,
 lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish.
 And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called
 seer.
 
 And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of
 Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and
 who has this high gift from God.
 
 And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.
 
 And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also;
 and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should
 possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have
 great power given him from God.
 
 But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of
 things which are to come, and by them shall all things be
 revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and
 hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known
 shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known
 by them which otherwise could not be known.
 
 Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might
 work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to
 his fellow beings.
 
 And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words
 the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying:
 Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and
 these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of
 unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.
 
 O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth
 he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable
 are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not
 seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over
 them!
 
 Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd,
 and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of
 the forest.
 
 
 I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the
 Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of
 the land of our fathers' first inheritance, and having been sent
 as a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces,
 that our army might come upon them and destroy them--but when I
 saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they
 should not be destroyed.
 
 Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness for
 I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he
 being an austere and a bloodthirsty man commanded that I should
 be slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for
 father fought against father, and brother against brother, until
 the greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness;
 and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of
 Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children.
 
 And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our
 fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess
 the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to
 go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore
 afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.
 
 Nevertheless, after many days' wandering in the wilderness we
 pitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain,
 which was near to the land of our fathers.
 
 And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men into
 the city, in unto the king, that I might know of the disposition
 of the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my
 people and possess the land in peace.
 
 And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I
 might possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.
 
 And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the
 land, and I and my people went into the land that we might
 possess it.
 
 And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of
 the city, yea, even the walls of the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the
 city of Shilom.
 
 And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of
 seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with
 neas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and
 we did begin to multiply and prosper in the land.
 
 Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to
 bring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we
 might possess it.
 
 Therefore it came to pass, that after we had dwelt in the
 land for the space of twelve years that king Laman began to grow
 uneasy, lest by any means my people should wax strong in the
 land, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into
 bondage.
 
 Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they
 were desirous to bring us into bondage, that they might glut
 themselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might
 feast themselves upon the flocks of our fields.
 
 Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began to stir up
 his people that they should contend with my people; therefore
 there began to be wars and contentions in the land.
 
 For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi,
 away on the south of the land of Shilom, when my people were
 watering and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a
 numerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them,
 and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.
 
 Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not
 overtaken, even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for
 protection.
 
 And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with
 arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with
 slings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and
 I and my people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle.
 
 Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle
 against the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to
 the Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our
 enemies, for we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance
 of our fathers.
 
 And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we
 did go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the
 Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand
 and forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them
 out of our land.
 
 And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their
 dead. And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two
 hundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.
 
 
 And it came to pass that we again began to establish the
 kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace. And I
 caused that there should be weapons of war made of every kind,
 that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time
 the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.
 
 And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites
 might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I
 did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling
 into the hands of our enemies.
 
 And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our
 fathers for many years, yea, for the space of twenty and two
 years.
 
 And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise
 all manner of grain and all manner of fruit of every kind.
 
 And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and
 work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and cloth of every
 kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper
 in the land--thus we did have continual peace in the land for the
 space of twenty and two years.
 
 And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son began to
 reign in his stead. And he began to stir his people up in
 rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for
 war, and to come up to battle against my people.
 
 But I had sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon,
 that I might discover their preparations, that I might guard
 against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy
 them.
 
 And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the
 land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men armed with bows,
 and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with
 stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that
 they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle
 about their loins.
 
 And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children
 of my people should be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused
 that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young
 men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves
 together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place
 them in their ranks, every man according to his age.
 
 And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the
 Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle
 against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did go up in
 the strength of the Lord to battle.
 
 Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the
 strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own
 strength. Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of
 men.
 
 They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people,
 believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is
 this--Believing that they were driven out of the land of
 Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that
 they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they
 were also wronged while crossing the sea;
 
 And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their
 first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this
 because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments
 of the Lord--therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord
 heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of
 their journey in the wilderness.
 
 And his brethren were wroth with him because they understood
 not the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon
 the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.
 
 And again, they were wroth with him when they had arrived in
 the promised land, because they said that he had taken the ruling
 of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.
 
 And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into
 the wilderness as the Lord had commanded him, and took the
 records which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said
 that he robbed them.
 
 And thus they have taught their children that they should
 hate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should
 rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them;
 therefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of
 Nephi.
 
 For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying
 craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have
 brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy
 them; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.
 
 And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my
 people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to
 battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord;
 therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.
 
 And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our
 land; and we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that
 we did not number them.
 
 And it came to pass that we returned again to our own land,
 and my people again began to tend their flocks, and to till their
 ground.
 
 And now I, being old, did confer the kingdom upon one of my
 sons; therefore, I say no more. And may the Lord bless my
 people. Amen.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon
 Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his
 stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.
 
 For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he
 did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many
 wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin,
 and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea,
 and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.
 
 And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a
 fifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of
 their ziff, and of their copper, and of their brass and their
 iron; and a fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth part
 of all their grain.
 
 And all this did he take to support himself, and his wives and
 his concubines; and also his priests, and their wives and their
 concubines; thus he had changed the affairs of the kingdom.
 
 For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated by
 his father, and consecrated new ones in their stead, such as were
 lifted up in the pride of their hearts.
 
 Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in
 their idolatry, and in their whoredoms, by the taxes which king
 Noah had put upon his people; thus did the people labor
 exceedingly to support iniquity.
 
 Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were
 deceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and
 priests; for they did speak flattering things unto them.
 
 And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and
 spacious buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of
 wood, and of all manner of precious things, of gold, and of
 silver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;
 
 And he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the
 midst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented
 with gold and silver and with precious things.
 
 And he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of
 fine work within the walls of the temple, of fine wood, and of
 copper, and of brass.
 
 And the seats which were set apart for the high priests,
 which were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure
 gold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that
 they might rest their bodies and their arms upon while they
 should speak lying and vain words to his people.
 
 And it came to pass that he built a tower near the temple;
 yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the
 top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of
 Shemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even
 look over all the land round about.
 
 And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built
 in the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on
 the hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for
 the children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and
 thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation
 of his people.
 
 And it came to pass that he placed his heart upon his riches,
 and he spent his time in riotous living with his wives and his
 concubines; and so did also his priests spend their time with
 harlots.
 
 And it came to pass that he planted vineyards round about in
 the land; and he built wine-presses, and made wine in abundance;
 and therefore he became a wine-bibber, and also his people.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lamanites began to come in upon
 his people, upon small numbers, and to slay them in their fields,
 and while they were tending their flocks.
 
 And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep them
 off; but he did not send a sufficient number, and the Lamanites
 came upon them and killed them, and drove many of their flocks
 out of the land; thus the Lamanites began to destroy them, and to
 exercise their hatred upon them.
 
 And it came to pass that king Noah sent his armies against
 them, and they were driven back, or they drove them back for a
 time; therefore, they returned rejoicing in their spoil.
 
 And now, because of this great victory they were lifted up in
 the pride of their hearts; they did boast in their own strength,
 saying that their fifty could stand against thousands of the
 Lamanites; and thus they did boast, and did delight in blood, and
 the shedding of the blood of their brethren, and this because of
 the wickedness of their king and priests.
 
 And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose
 name was Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to
 prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he
 commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus
 saith the Lord--Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their
 abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and
 except they repent I will visit them in mine anger.
 
 And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God,
 behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea,
 and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be
 afflicted by the hand of their enemies.
 
 And it shall come to pass that they shall know that I am the
 Lord their God, and am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of
 my people.
 
 And it shall come to pass that except this people repent and
 turn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into bondage;
 and none shall deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty
 God.
 
 Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto
 me I will be slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer
 them that they be smitten by their enemies.
 
 And except they repent in sackcloth and ashes, and cry
 mightily to the Lord their God, I will not hear their prayers,
 neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus
 saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me.
 
 Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words
 unto them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his
 life; but the Lord delivered him out of their hands.
 
 Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had
 spoken unto the people, he was also wroth; and he said: Who is
 Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is
 the Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?
 
 I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him,
 for he has said these things that he might stir up my people to
 anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people;
 therefore I will slay him.
 
 Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore they
 hardened their hearts against the words of Abinadi, and they
 sought from that time forward to take him. And king Noah
 hardened his heart against the word of the Lord, and he did not
 repent of his evil doings.
 
 
 And it came to pass that after the space of two years that
 Abinadi came among them in disguise, that they knew him not, and
 began to prophesy among them, saying: Thus has the Lord commanded
 me, saying--Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for
 they have hardened their hearts against my words; they have
 repented not of their evil doings; therefore, I will visit them
 in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their
 iniquities and abominations.
 
 Yea, wo be unto this generation! And the Lord said unto me:
 Stretch forth thy hand and prophesy saying: Thus saith the Lord,
 it shall come to pass that this generation, because of their
 iniquities, shall be brought into bondage, and shall be smitten
 on the cheek; yea, and shall be driven by men, and shall be
 slain; and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea, and the
 wild beasts, shall devour their flesh.
 
 And it shall come to pass that the life of king Noah shall be
 valued even as a garment in a hot furnace; for he shall know that
 I am the Lord.
 
 And it shall come to pass that I will smite this my people
 with sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with pestilence; and
 I will cause that they shall howl all the day long.
 
 Yea, and I will cause that they shall have burdens lashed upon
 their backs; and they shall be driven before like a dumb ass.
 
 And it shall come to pass that I will send forth hail among
 them, and it shall smite them; and they shall also be smitten
 with the east wind; and insects shall pester their land also, and
 devour their grain.
 
 And they shall be smitten with a great pestilence--and all
 this will I do because of their iniquities and abominations.
 
 And it shall come to pass that except they repent I will
 utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth; yet they
 shall leave a record behind them, and I will preserve them for
 other nations which shall possess the land; yea, even this will I
 do that I may discover the abominations of this people to other
 nations. And many things did Abinadi prophesy against this
 people.
 
 And it came to pass that they were angry with him; and they
 took him and carried him bound before the king, and said unto the
 king: Behold, we have brought a man before thee who has
 prophesied evil concerning thy people, and saith that God will
 destroy them.
 
 And he also prophesieth evil concerning thy life, and saith
 that thy life shall be as a garment in a furnace of fire.
 
 And again, he saith that thou shalt be as a stalk, even as a
 dry stalk of the field, which is run over by the beasts and
 trodden under foot.
 
 And again, he saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a
 thistle, which, when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is
 driven forth upon the face of the land. And he pretendeth the
 Lord hath spoken it. And he saith all this shall come upon thee
 except thou repent, and this because of thine iniquities.
 
 And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done, or what
 great sins have thy people committed, that we should be condemned
 of God or judged of this man?
 
 And now, O king, behold, we are guiltless, and thou, O king,
 hast not sinned; therefore, this man has lied concerning you, and
 he has prophesied in vain.
 
 And behold, we are strong, we shall not come into bondage, or
 be taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in
 the land, and thou shalt also prosper.
 
 Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands; thou
 mayest do with him as seemeth thee good.
 
 And it came to pass that king Noah caused that Abinadi should
 be cast into prison; and he commanded that the priests should
 gather themselves together that he might hold a council with them
 what he should do with him.
 
 And it came to pass that they said unto the king: Bring him
 hither that we may question him; and the king commanded that he
 should be brought before them.
 
 And they began to question him, that they might cross him,
 that thereby they might have wherewith to accuse him; but he
 answered them boldly, and withstood all their questions, yea, to
 their astonishment; for he did withstand them in all their
 questions, and did confound them in all their words.
 
 And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What
 meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught
 by our fathers, saying:
 
 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
 bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good
 tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion,
 Thy God reigneth;
 
 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together
 shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord
 shall bring again Zion;
 
 Break forth into joy; sing together ye waste places of
 Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath
 redeemed Jerusalem;
 
 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
 nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of
 our God?
 
 And now Abinadi said unto them: Are you priests, and pretend
 to teach this people, and to understand the spirit of
 prophesying, and yet desire to know of me what these things mean?
 
 I say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the
 Lord! For if ye understand these things ye have not taught them;
 therefore, ye have perverted the ways of the Lord.
 
 Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore,
 ye have not been wise. Therefore, what teach ye this people?
 
 And they said: We teach the law of Moses.
 
 And again he said unto them: If ye teach the law of Moses why
 do ye not keep it? Why do ye set your hearts upon riches? Why
 do ye commit whoredoms and spend your strength with harlots, yea,
 and cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord has cause to
 send me to prophesy against this people, yea, even a great evil
 against this people?
 
 Know ye not that I speak the truth? Yea, ye know that I
 speak the truth; and you ought to tremble before God.
 
 And it shall come to pass that ye shall be smitten for your
 iniquities, for ye have said that ye teach the law of Moses. And
 what know ye concerning the law of Moses? Doth salvation come by
 the law of Moses? What say ye?
 
 And they answered and said that salvation did come by the law
 of Moses.
 
 But now Abinadi said unto them: I know if ye keep the
 commandments of God ye shall be saved; yea, if ye keep the
 commandments which the Lord delivered unto Moses in the mount of
 Sinai, saying:
 
 I am the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee out of the land
 of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
 
 Thou shalt have no other God before me.
 
 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
 likeness of any thing in heaven above, or things which are in the
 earth beneath.
 
 Now Abinadi said unto them, Have ye done all this? I say
 unto you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye taught this people that
 they should do all these things? I say unto you, Nay, ye have
 not.
 
 
 And now when the king had heard these words, he said unto his
 priests: Away with this fellow, and slay him; for what have we to
 do with him, for he is mad.
 
 And they stood forth and attempted to lay their hands on him;
 but he withstood them, and said unto them:
 
 Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands
 upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent
 me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested
 that I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall
 be destroyed at this time.
 
 But I must fulfil the commandments wherewith God has commanded
 me; and because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me.
 And again, because I have spoken the word of God ye have judged
 me that I am mad.
 
 Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken these words that
 the people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on him, for the
 Spirit of the Lord was upon him; and his face shone with
 exceeding luster, even as Moses' did while in the mount of Sinai,
 while speaking with the Lord.
 
 And he spake with power and authority from God; and he
 continued his words, saying:
 
 Ye see that ye have not power to slay me, therefore I finish
 my message. Yea, and I perceive that it cuts you to your hearts
 because I tell you the truth concerning your iniquities.
 
 Yea, and my words fill you with wonder and amazement, and with
 anger.
 
 But I finish my message; and then it matters not whither I go,
 if it so be that I am saved.
 
 But this much I tell you, what you do with me, after this,
 shall be as a type and a shadow of things which are to come.
 
 And now I read unto you the remainder of the commandments of
 God, for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts; I
 perceive that ye have studied and taught iniquity the most part
 of your lives.
 
 And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou shall not
 make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of things which
 are in heaven above, or which are in the earth beneath, or which
 are in the water under the earth.
 
 And again: Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor
 serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the
 iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and
 fourth generations of them that hate me;
 
 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and
 keep my commandments.
 
 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for
 the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
 vain.
 
 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
 
 Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
 
 But the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord thy God, thou
 shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
 man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
 stranger that is within thy gates;
 
 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea,
 and all that in them is; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath
 day, and hallowed it.
 
 Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long
 upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
 
 Thou shalt not kill.
 
 Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal.
 
 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
 
 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not
 covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his
 maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy
 neighbor's.
 
 And it came to pass that after Abinadi had made an end of
 these sayings that he said unto them: Have ye taught this people
 that they should observe to do all these things for to keep these
 commandments?
 
 I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord would not have
 caused me to come forth and to prophesy evil concerning this
 people.
 
 And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of
 Moses. I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep
 the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall
 come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.
 
 And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by
 the law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God
 himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people,
 that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of
 Moses.
 
 And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there
 should be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very
 strict law; for they were a stiffnecked people, quick to do
 iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;
 
 Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of
 performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe
 strictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and
 their duty towards him.
 
 But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were types
 of things to come.
 
 And now, did they understand the law? I say unto you, Nay,
 they did not all understand the law; and this because of the
 hardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there
 could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption
 of God.
 
 For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them concerning the
 coming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people?
 Yea, and even all the prophets who have prophesied ever since the
 world began--have they not spoken more or less concerning these
 things?
 
 Have they not said that God himself should come down among
 the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go
 forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?
 
 Yea, and have they not said also that he should bring to pass
 the resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, should be
 oppressed and afflicted?
 
 
 Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath believed our report,
 and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
 
 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a
 root out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when
 we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him.
 
 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
 acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him;
 he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
 
 Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet
 we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.
 
 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
 our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and
 with his stripes we are healed.
 
 All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one
 to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of
 us all.
 
 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
 mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep
 before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth.
 
 He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall
 declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of
 the living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken.
 
 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
 his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in
 his mouth.
 
 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to
 grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall
 see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the
 Lord shall prosper in his hand.
 
 He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied;
 by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he
 shall bear their iniquities.
 
 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
 shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured
 out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the
 transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made
 intercession for the transgressors.
 
 
 And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye should
 understand that God himself shall come down among the children of
 men, and shall redeem his people.
 
 And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of
 God, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father,
 being the Father and the Son--
 
 The Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and
 the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son--
 
 And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven
 and of earth.
 
 And thus the flesh becoming subject to the Spirit, or the Son
 to the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth
 not to the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and
 scourged, and cast out, and disowned by his people.
 
 And after all this, after working many mighty miracles among
 the children of men, he shall be led, yea, even as Isaiah said,
 as a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his
 mouth.
 
 Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh
 becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being
 swallowed up in the will of the Father.
 
 And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the
 victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for
 the children of men--
 
 Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being
 filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing
 betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken
 upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having
 redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.
 
 And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation?
 Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an
 offering for sin he shall see his seed. And now what say ye?
 And who shall be his seed?
 
 Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of
 the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied
 concerning the coming of the Lord--I say unto you, that all those
 who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord
 would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for
 a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his
 seed, or they are heirs of the kingdom of God.
 
 For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they
 for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions.
 And now, are they not his seed?
 
 Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that has opened his
 mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean
 all the holy prophets ever since the world began? I say unto you
 that they are his seed.
 
 And these are they who have published peace, who have brought
 good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto
 Zion: Thy God reigneth!
 
 And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!
 
 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of
 those that are still publishing peace!
 
 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of
 those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time
 henceforth and forever!
 
 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how
 beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth
 good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord,
 who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation
 unto his people;
 
 For were it not for the redemption which he hath made for his
 people, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, I
 say unto you, were it not for this, all mankind must have
 perished.
 
 But behold, the bands of death shall be broken, and the Son
 reigneth, and hath power over the dead; therefore, he bringeth to
 pass the resurrection of the dead.
 
 And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection;
 yea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and who are,
 and who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ--for so
 shall he be called.
 
 And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those
 that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept
 the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first
 resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection.
 
 They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus
 they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands
 of death.
 
 And these are those who have part in the first resurrection;
 and these are they that have died before Christ came, in their
 ignorance, not having salvation declared unto them. And thus the
 Lord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a
 part in the first resurrection, or have eternal life, being
 redeemed by the Lord.
 
 And little children also have eternal life.
 
 But behold, and fear, and tremble before God, for ye ought to
 tremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that rebel against him
 and die in their sins; yea, even all those that have perished in
 their sins ever since the world began, that have wilfully
 rebelled against God, that have known the commandments of God,
 and would not keep them; these are they that have no part in the
 first resurrection.
 
 Therefore ought ye not to tremble? For salvation cometh to
 none such; for the Lord hath redeemed none such; yea, neither can
 the Lord redeem such; for he cannot deny himself; for he cannot
 deny justice when it has its claim.
 
 And now I say unto you that the time shall come that the
 salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred,
 tongue, and people.
 
 Yea, Lord, thy watchmen shall lift up their voice; with the
 voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye,
 when the Lord shall bring again Zion.
 
 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
 Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath
 redeemed Jerusalem.
 
 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
 nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of
 our God.
 
 
 And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these
 words he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come
 when all shall see the salvation of the Lord; when every nation,
 kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall
 confess before God that his judgments are just.
 
 And then shall the wicked be cast out, and they shall have
 cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and
 this because they would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord;
 therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.
 
 For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over
 them; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first
 parents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause
 of all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing evil
 from good, subjecting themselves to the devil.
 
 Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been
 endlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from
 their lost and fallen state.
 
 But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature,
 and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God,
 remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over
 him. Therefore, he is as though there was no redemption made,
 being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.
 
 And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of
 things to come as though they had already come, there could have
 been no redemption.
 
 And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the
 bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that
 death should have no sting, there could have been no
 resurrection.
 
 But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no
 victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.
 
 He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that
 is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life
 which is endless, that there can be no more death.
 
 Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this
 corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to
 stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to
 their works whether they be good or whether they be evil--
 
 If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and
 happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless
 damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected
 them, which is damnation--
 
 Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires;
 having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were
 extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended
 towards them, and they would not; they being warned of their
 iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were
 commanded to repent and yet they would not repent.
 
 And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and
 remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved?
 
 Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses, also teach that it
 is a shadow of those things which are to come--
 
 Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord,
 who is the very Eternal Father. Amen.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that when Abinadi had finished these
 sayings, that the king commanded that the priests should take him
 and cause that he should be put to death.
 
 But there was one among them whose name was Alma, he also
 being a descendant of Nephi. And he was a young man, and he
 believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew
 concerning the iniquity which Abinadi has testified against them;
 therefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be
 angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace.
 
 But the king was more wroth, and caused that Alma should be
 cast out from among them, and sent his servants after him that
 they might slay him.
 
 But he fled from before them and hid himself that they found
 him not. And he being concealed for many days did write all the
 words which Abinadi had spoken.
 
 And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards
 should surround Abinadi and take him; and they bound him and cast
 him into prison.
 
 And after three days, having counseled with his priests, he
 caused that he should again be brought before him.
 
 And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation
 against thee, and thou art worthy of death.
 
 For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the
 children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to
 death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast
 spoken evil concerning me and my people.
 
 Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I will not recall
 the words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people,
 for they are true; and that ye may know of their surety I have
 suffered myself that I have fallen into your hands.
 
 Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not
 recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you.
 
 And if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall
 also stand as a testimony against you at the last day.
 
 And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his
 word; for he feared that the judgments of God would come upon
 him.
 
 But the priests lifted up their voices against him, and began
 to accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king. Therefore the
 king was stirred up in anger against him, and he delivered him up
 that he might be slain.
 
 And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and
 scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death.
 
 And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto
 them, saying:
 
 Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to
 pass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains
 that I do suffer, even the pains of death by fire; and this
 because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.
 
 And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all
 manner of diseases because of your iniquities.
 
 Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be
 driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven
 by wild and ferocious beasts.
 
 And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by
 the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer,
 the pains of death by fire.
 
 Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his
 people. O God, receive my soul.
 
 And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having
 suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he
 would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth
 of his words by his death.
 
 
 And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the
 servants of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and
 went about privately among the people, and began to teach the
 words of Abinadi--
 
 Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning
 the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people,
 which was to be brought to pass through the power, and
 sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and
 ascension into heaven.
 
 And as many as would hear his word he did teach. And he
 taught them privately, that it might not come to the knowledge of
 the king. And many did believe his words.
 
 And it came to pass that as many as did believe him did go
 forth to a place which was called Mormon, having received its
 name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been
 infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.
 
 Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma
 resorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small
 trees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches
 of the king.
 
 And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither
 to hear his words.
 
 And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number
 gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of
 Alma. Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word,
 to hear him. And he did teach them, and did preach unto them
 repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are
 the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye
 are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his
 people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they
 may be light;
 
 Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and
 comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as
 witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all
 places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be
 redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first
 resurrection, that ye may have eternal life--
 
 Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts,
 what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as
 a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with
 him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he
 may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?
 
 And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped
 their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our
 hearts.
 
 And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of
 the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried,
 saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may
 do this work with holiness of heart.
 
 And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was
 upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority
 from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a
 covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body;
 and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he
 grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ,
 whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.
 
 And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were
 buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the
 water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.
 
 And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time
 into the water, and baptized him according to the first, only he
 did not bury himself again in the water.
 
 And after this manner he did baptize every one that went
 forth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two
 hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters
 of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God.
 
 And they were called the church of God, or the church of
 Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that
 whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was
 added to his church.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma, having authority from God,
 ordained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number
 did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning
 the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
 
 And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it
 were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by
 the mouth of the holy prophets.
 
 Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing
 save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed
 his people.
 
 And he commanded them that there should be no contention one
 with another, but that they should look forward with one eye,
 having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit
 together in unity and in love one towards another.
 
 And thus he commanded them to preach. And thus they became
 the children of God.
 
 And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath
 day, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks
 to the Lord their God.
 
 And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had
 ordained should labor with their own hands for their support.
 
 And there was one day in every week that was set apart that
 they should gather themselves together to teach the people, and
 to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in
 their power, to assemble themselves together.
 
 And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their
 support; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of
 God, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the
 knowledge of God, that they might teach with power and authority
 from God.
 
 And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should
 impart of their substance, every one according to that which he
 had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly;
 and of him that had but little, but little should be required;
 and to him that had not should be given.
 
 And thus they should impart of their substance of their own
 free will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that
 stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.
 
 And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and
 they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both
 temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their
 wants.
 
 And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon,
 yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the
 waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon,
 the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them
 who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how
 blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.
 
 And these things were done in the borders of the land, that
 they might not come to the knowledge of the king.
 
 But behold, it came to pass that the king, having discovered
 a movement among the people, sent his servants to watch them.
 Therefore on the day that they were assembling themselves
 together to hear the word of the Lord they were discovered unto
 the king.
 
 And now the king said that Alma was stirring up the people to
 rebellion against him; therefore he sent his army to destroy
 them.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma and the people of the Lord were
 apprised of the coming of the king's army; therefore they took
 their tents and their families and departed into the wilderness.
 
 And they were in number about four hundred and fifty souls.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the army of the king returned, having
 searched in vain for the people of the Lord.
 
 And now behold, the forces of the king were small, having been
 reduced, and there began to be a division among the remainder of
 the people.
 
 And the lesser part began to breathe out threatenings against
 the king, and there began to be a great contention among them.
 
 And now there was a man among them whose name was Gideon, and
 he being a strong man and an enemy to the king, therefore he drew
 his sword, and swore in his wrath that he would slay the king.
 
 And it came to pass that he fought with the king; and when the
 king saw that he was about to overpower him, he fled and ran and
 got upon the tower which was near the temple.
 
 And Gideon pursued after him and was about to get upon the
 tower to slay the king, and the king cast his eyes round about
 towards the land of Shemlon, and behold, the army of the
 Lamanites were within the borders of the land.
 
 And now the king cried out in the anguish of his soul, saying:
 Gideon, spare me, for the Lamanites are upon us, and they will
 destroy us; yea, they will destroy my people.
 
 And now the king was not so much concerned about his people as
 he was about his own life; nevertheless, Gideon did spare his
 life.
 
 And the king commanded the people that they should flee before
 the Lamanites, and he himself did go before them, and they did
 flee into the wilderness, with their women and their children.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue them, and
 did overtake them, and began to slay them.
 
 Now it came to pass that the king commanded them that all the
 men should leave their wives and their children, and flee before
 the Lamanites.
 
 Now there were many that would not leave them, but had rather
 stay and perish with them. And the rest left their wives and
 their children and fled.
 
 And it came to pass that those who tarried with their wives
 and their children caused that their fair daughters should stand
 forth and plead with the Lamanites that they would not slay them.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lamanites had compassion on
 them, for they were charmed with the beauty of their women.
 
 Therefore the Lamanites did spare their lives, and took them
 captives and carried them back to the land of Nephi, and granted
 unto them that they might possess the land, under the conditions
 that they would deliver up king Noah into the hands of the
 Lamanites, and deliver up their property, even one half of all
 they possessed, one half of their gold, and their silver, and all
 their precious things, and thus they should pay tribute to the
 king of the Lamanites from year to year.
 
 And now there was one of the sons of the king among those
 that were taken captive, whose name was Limhi.
 
 And now Limhi was desirous that his father should not be
 destroyed; nevertheless, Limhi was not ignorant of the iniquities
 of his father, he himself being a just man.
 
 And it came to pass that Gideon sent men into the wilderness
 secretly, to search for the king and those that were with him.
 And it came to pass that they met the people in the wilderness,
 all save the king and his priests.
 
 Now they had sworn in their hearts that they would return to
 the land of Nephi, and if their wives and their children were
 slain, and also those that had tarried with them, that they would
 seek revenge, and also perish with them.
 
 And the king commanded them that they should not return; and
 they were angry with the king, and caused that he should suffer,
 even unto death by fire.
 
 And they were about to take the priests also and put them to
 death, and they fled before them.
 
 And it came to pass that they were about to return to the
 land of Nephi, and they met the men of Gideon. And the men of
 Gideon told them of all that had happened to their wives and
 their children; and that the Lamanites had granted unto them that
 they might possess the land by paying a tribute to the Lamanites
 of one half of all they possessed.
 
 And the people told the men of Gideon that they had slain the
 king, and his priests had fled from them farther into the
 wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that after they had ended the ceremony,
 that they returned to the land of Nephi, rejoicing, because their
 wives and their children were not slain; and they told Gideon
 what they had done to the king.
 
 And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites made an
 oath unto them, that his people should not slay them.
 
 And also Limhi, being the son of the king, having the kingdom
 conferred upon him by the people, made oath unto the king of the
 Lamanites that his people should pay tribute unto him, even one
 half of all they possessed.
 
 And it came to pass that Limhi began to establish the kingdom
 and to establish peace among his people.
 
 And the king of the Lamanites set guards round about the
 land, that he might keep the people of Limhi in the land, that
 they might not depart into the wilderness; and he did support his
 guards out of the tribute which he did receive from the Nephites.
 
 And now king Limhi did have continual peace in his kingdom
 for the space of two years, that the Lamanites did not molest
 them nor seek to destroy them.
 
 
 Now there was a place in Shemlon where the daughters of the
 Lamanites did gather themselves together to sing, and to dance,
 and to make themselves merry.
 
 And it came to pass that there was one day a small number of
 them gathered together to sing and to dance.
 
 And now the priests of king Noah, being ashamed to return to
 the city of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that the people would
 slay them, therefore they durst not return to their wives and
 their children.
 
 And having tarried in the wilderness, and having discovered
 the daughters of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them;
 
 And when there were but few of them gathered together to
 dance, they came forth out of their secret places and took them
 and carried them into the wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the
 daughters of the Lamanites they carried into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that their
 daughters had been missing, they were angry with the people of
 Limhi, for they thought it was the people of Limhi.
 
 Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea, even the king
 himself went before his people; and they went up to the land of
 Nephi to destroy the people of Limhi.
 
 And now Limhi had discovered them from the tower, even all
 their preparations for war did he discover; therefore he gathered
 his people together, and laid wait for them in the fields and in
 the forests.
 
 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had come up, that
 the people of Limhi began to fall upon them from their waiting
 places, and began to slay them.
 
 And it came to pass that the battle became exceedingly sore,
 for they fought like lions for their prey.
 
 And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive
 the Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as
 the Lamanites. But they fought for their lives, and for their
 wives, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves
 and like dragons did they fight.
 
 And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites
 among the number of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been
 wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his
 people.
 
 And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him
 before Limhi, and said: Behold, here is the king of the
 Lamanites; he having received a wound has fallen among their
 dead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him
 before you; and now let us slay him
 
 But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring
 him hither that I may see him. And they brought him. And Limhi
 said unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my
 people? Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made
 unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made
 unto my people?
 
 And now the king said: I have broken the oath because thy
 people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in
 my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy
 people.
 
 And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter;
 therefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever
 has done this thing shall perish. Therefore he caused a search
 to be made among his people.
 
 Now when Gideon had heard these things, he being the king's
 captain, he went forth and said unto the king: I pray thee
 forbear, and do not search this people, and lay not this thing to
 their charge.
 
 For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, whom this
 people sought to destroy? And are they not in the wilderness?
 And are not they the ones who have stolen the daughters of the
 Lamanites?
 
 And now, behold, and tell the king of these things, that he
 may tell his people that they may be pacified towards us; for
 behold they are already preparing to come against us; and behold
 also there are but few of us.
 
 And behold, they come with their numerous hosts; and except
 the king doth pacify them towards us we must perish.
 
 For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled, which he
 prophesied against us--and all this because we would not hearken
 unto the words of the Lord, and turn from our iniquities?
 
 And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil the oath which
 we have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in
 bondage than that we should lose our lives; therefore, let us put
 a stop to the shedding of so much blood.
 
 And now Limhi told the king all the things concerning his
 father, and the priests that had fled into the wilderness, and
 attributed the carrying away of their daughters to them.
 
 And it came to pass that the king was pacified towards his
 people; and he said unto them: Let us go forth to meet my people,
 without arms; and I swear unto you with an oath that my people
 shall not slay thy people.
 
 And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went
 forth without arms to meet the Lamanites. And it came to pass
 that they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites
 did bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the
 people of Limhi.
 
 And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi, that they
 were without arms, they had compassion on them and were pacified
 towards them, and returned with their king in peace to their own
 land.
 
 
 And it came to pass that Limhi and his people returned to the
 city of Nephi, and began to dwell in the land again in peace.
 
 And it came to pass that after many days the Lamanites began
 again to be stirred up in anger against the Nephites, and they
 began to come into the borders of the land round about.
 
 Now they durst not slay them, because of the oath which their
 king had made unto Limhi; but they would smite them on their
 cheeks, and exercise authority over them; and began to put heavy
 burdens upon their backs, and drive them as they would a dumb
 ass--
 
 Yea, all this was done that the word of the Lord might be
 fulfilled.
 
 And now the afflictions of the Nephites were great, and there
 was no way that they could deliver themselves out of their hands,
 for the Lamanites had surrounded them on every side.
 
 And it came to pass that the people began to murmur with the
 king because of their afflictions; and they began to be desirous
 to go against them to battle. And they did afflict the king
 sorely with their complaints; therefore he granted unto them that
 they should do according to their desires.
 
 And they gathered themselves together again, and put on their
 armor, and went forth against the Lamanites to drive them out of
 their land.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat them, and
 drove them back, and slew many of them.
 
 And now there was a great mourning and lamentation among the
 people of Limhi, the widow mourning for her husband, the son and
 the daughter mourning for their father, and the brothers for
 their brethren.
 
 Now there were a great many widows in the land, and they did
 cry mightily from day to day, for a great fear of the Lamanites
 had come upon them.
 
 And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up
 the remainder of the people of Limhi to anger against the
 Lamanites; and they went again to battle, but they were driven
 back again, suffering much loss.
 
 Yea, they went again even the third time, and suffered in the
 like manner; and those that were not slain returned again to the
 city of Nephi.
 
 And they did humble themselves even to the dust, subjecting
 themselves to the yoke of bondage, submitting themselves to be
 smitten, and to be driven to and fro, and burdened, according to
 the desires of their enemies.
 
 And they did humble themselves even in the depths of
 humility; and they did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day
 long did they cry unto their God that he would deliver them out
 of their afflictions.
 
 And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their
 iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began
 to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease
 their burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out
 of bondage.
 
 And it came to pass that they began to prosper by degrees in
 the land, and began to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks,
 and herds, that they did not suffer with hunger.
 
 Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of
 men; therefore king Limhi commanded that every man should impart
 to the support of the widows and their children, that they might
 not perish with hunger; and this they did because of the
 greatness of their number that had been slain.
 
 Now the people of Limhi kept together in a body as much as it
 was possible, and secured their grain and their flocks;
 
 And the king himself did not trust his person without the
 walls of the city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing
 that he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.
 
 And he caused that his people should watch the land round
 about, that by some means they might take those priests that fled
 into the wilderness, who had stolen the daughters of the
 Lamanites, and that had caused such a great destruction to come
 upon them.
 
 For they were desirous to take them that they might punish
 them; for they had come into the land of Nephi by night, and
 carried off their grain and many of their precious things;
 therefore they laid wait for them.
 
 And it came to pass that there was no more disturbance
 between the Lamanites and the people of Limhi, even until the
 time that Ammon and his brethren came into the land.
 
 And the king having been without the gates of the city with
 his guard, discovered Ammon and his brethren; and supposing them
 to be priests of Noah therefore he caused that they should be
 taken, and bound, and cast into prison. And had they been the
 priests of Noah he would have caused that they should be put to
 death.
 
 But when he found that they were not, but that they were his
 brethren, and had come from the land of Zarahemla, he was filled
 with exceedingly great joy.
 
 Now king Limhi had sent, previous to the coming of Ammon, a
 small number of men to search for the land of Zarahemla; but they
 could not find it, and they were lost in the wilderness.
 
 Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled;
 yea, a land which was covered with dry bones; yea, a land which
 had been peopled and which had been destroyed; and they, having
 supposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of
 Nephi, having arrived in the borders of the land not many days
 before the coming of Ammon.
 
 And they brought a record with them, even a record of the
 people whose bones they had found; and it was engraven on plates
 of ore.
 
 And now Limhi was again filled with joy in learning from the
 mouth of Ammon that king Mosiah had a gift from God, whereby he
 could interpret such engravings; yea, and Ammon also did rejoice.
 
 Yet Ammon and his brethren were filled with sorrow because so
 many of their brethren had been slain;
 
 And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people
 to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also
 did mourn for the death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of
 Alma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church
 of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the
 words which had been spoken by Abinadi.
 
 Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not
 whither they had fled. Now they would have gladly joined with
 them, for they themselves had entered into a covenant with God to
 serve him and keep his commandments.
 
 And now since the coming of Ammon, king Limhi had also
 entered into a covenant with God, and also many of his people, to
 serve him and keep his commandments.
 
 And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of his people
 were desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that
 had authority from God. And Ammon declined doing this thing,
 considering himself an unworthy servant.
 
 Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a
 church, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord. Now they were
 desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled
 into the wilderness.
 
 They were desirous to be baptized as a witness and a
 testimony that they were willing to serve God with all their
 hearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time; and an account of
 their baptism shall be given hereafter.
 
 And now all the study of Ammon and his people, and king Limhi
 and his people, was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the
 Lamanites and from bondage.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to
 consult with the people how they should deliver themselves out of
 bondage; and even they did cause that all the people should
 gather themselves together; and this they did that they might
 have the voice of the people concerning the matter.
 
 And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver
 themselves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and
 children, and their flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and
 depart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so numerous,
 it was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them,
 thinking to deliver themselves out of bondage by the sword.
 
 Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and stood before
 the king, and said unto him: Now O king, thou hast hitherto
 hearkened unto my words many times when we have been contending
 with our brethren, the Lamanites.
 
 And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be an
 unprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my
 words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even
 so I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time,
 and I will be thy servant and deliver this people out of bondage.
 
 And the king granted unto him that he might speak. And Gideon
 said unto him:
 
 Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side
 of the city. The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by
 night are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all
 this people that they gather together their flocks and herds,
 that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.
 
 And I will go according to thy command and pay the last
 tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and
 we will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp
 when they are drunken and asleep.
 
 Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our
 flocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel
 around the land of Shilom.
 
 And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of
 Gideon.
 
 And king Limhi caused that his people should gather their
 flocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the
 Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto them;
 and they did drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send
 unto them.
 
 And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart
 by night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds,
 and they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness,
 and bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by
 Ammon and his brethren.
 
 And they had taken all their gold, and silver, and their
 precious things, which they could carry, and also their
 provisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their
 journey.
 
 And after being many days in the wilderness they arrived in
 the land of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah's people, and became his
 subjects.
 
 And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and
 he also received their records, and also the records which had
 been found by the people of Limhi.
 
 And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the
 people of Limhi had departed out of the land by night, that they
 sent an army into the wilderness to pursue them;
 
 And after they had pursued them two days, they could no
 longer follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in the
 wilderness.
 
 
 Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord that the armies of
 king Noah would come upon them, and having made it known to his
 people, therefore they gathered together their flocks, and took
 of their grain, and departed into the wilderness before the
 armies of king Noah.
 
 And the Lord did strengthen them, that the people of king Noah
 could not overtake them to destroy them.
 
 And they fled eight days' journey into the wilderness.
 
 And they came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and
 pleasant land, a land of pure water.
 
 And they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground,
 and began to build buildings; yea, they were industrious, and did
 labor exceedingly.
 
 And the people were desirous that Alma should be their king,
 for he was beloved by his people.
 
 But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we
 should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem
 one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above
 another; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye
 should have a king.
 
 Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could always have
 just men to be your kings it would be well for you to have a
 king.
 
 But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his priests; and I
 myself was caught in a snare, and did many things which were
 abominable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore
 repentance;
 
 Nevertheless, after much tribulation, the Lord did hear my
 cries, and did answer my prayers, and has made me an instrument
 in his hands in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his
 truth.
 
 Nevertheless, in this I do not glory, for I am unworthy to
 glory of myself.
 
 And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah,
 and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been
 brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the
 bands of iniquity.
 
 And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of
 these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his
 people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire
 that ye should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been
 made free, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you.
 
 And also trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister,
 except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his
 commandments.
 
 Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man should love
 his neighbor as himself, that there should be no contention among
 them.
 
 And now, Alma was their high priest, he being the founder of
 their church.
 
 And it came to pass that none received authority to preach or
 to teach except it were by him from God. Therefore he
 consecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none
 were consecrated except they were just men.
 
 Therefore they did watch over their people, and did nourish
 them with things pertaining to righteousness.
 
 And it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in
 the land; and they called the land Helam.
 
 And it came to pass that they did multiply and prosper
 exceedingly in the land of Helam; and they built a city, which
 they called the city of Helam.
 
 Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea,
 he trieth their patience and their faith.
 
 Nevertheless--whosoever putteth his trust in him the same
 shall be lifted up at the last day. Yea, and thus it was with
 this people.
 
 For behold, I will show unto you that they were brought into
 bondage, and none could deliver them but the Lord their God, yea,
 even the God of Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob.
 
 And it came to pass that he did deliver them, and he did show
 forth his mighty power unto them, and great were their
 rejoicings.
 
 For behold, it came to pass that while they were in the land
 of Helam, yea, in the city of Helam, while tilling the land round
 about, behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the
 land.
 
 Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma fled from their
 fields, and gathered themselves together in the city of Helam;
 and they were much frightened because of the appearance of the
 Lamanites.
 
 But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them
 that they should not be frightened, but that they should remember
 the Lord their God and he would deliver them.
 
 Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the
 Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they
 would spare them, and their wives, and their children.
 
 And it came to pass the the Lord did soften the hearts of the
 Lamanites. And Alma and his brethren went forth and delivered
 themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession
 of the land of Helam.
 
 Now the armies of the Lamanites, which had followed after the
 people of king Limhi, had been lost in the wilderness for many
 days.
 
 And behold, they had found those priests of king Noah, in a
 place which they called Amulon; and they had begun to possess the
 land of Amulon and had begun to till the ground.
 
 Now the name of the leader of those priests was Amulon.
 
 And it came to pass that Amulon did plead with the Lamanites;
 and he also sent forth their wives, who were the daughters of the
 Lamanites, to plead with their brethren, that they should not
 destroy their husbands.
 
 And the Lamanites had compassion on Amulon and his brethren,
 and did not destroy them, because of their wives.
 
 And Amulon and his brethren did join the Lamanites, and they
 were traveling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi
 when they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by
 Alma and his brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and
 his brethren, that if they would show them the way which led to
 the land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and
 their liberty.
 
 But after Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of
 Nephi the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set
 guards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren.
 
 And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a
 part of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with
 them the wives and the children of the guards who had been left
 in the land.
 
 And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he
 should be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the
 land of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do
 anything contrary to the will of the king of the Lamanites.
 
 
 And it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of
 the king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites
 granted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed
 teachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in
 the land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the land
 of Amulon.
 
 For the Lamanites had taken possession of all these lands;
 therefore, the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over all
 these lands.
 
 And now the name of the king of the Lamanites was Laman, being
 called after the name of his father; and therefore he was called
 king Laman. And he was king over a numerous people.
 
 And he appointed teachers of the brethren of Amulon in every
 land which was possessed by his people; and thus the language of
 Nephi began to be taught among all the people of the Lamanites.
 
 And they were a people friendly one with another; nevertheless
 they knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them
 anything concerning the Lord their God, neither the law of Moses;
 nor did they teach them the words of Abinadi;
 
 But they taught them that they should keep their record, and
 that they might write one to another.
 
 And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began
 to trade one with another and wax great, and began to be a
 cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a
 very cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and
 plunder, except it were among their own brethren.
 
 And now it came to pass that Amulon began to exercise
 authority over Alma and his brethren, and began to persecute him,
 and cause that his children should persecute their children.
 
 For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king's
 priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi
 and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth
 with him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised
 authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put
 task-masters over them.
 
 And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that
 they began to cry mightily to God.
 
 And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries;
 and he put guards over them to watch them, that whosoever should
 be found calling upon God should be put to death.
 
 And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the
 Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did
 know the thoughts of their hearts.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them
 in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good
 comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me;
 and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of
 bondage.
 
 And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your
 shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even
 while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as
 witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that
 I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.
 
 And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon
 Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did
 strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease,
 and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will
 of the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their
 patience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying:
 Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of
 bondage.
 
 And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go before this people, and
 I will go with thee and deliver this people out of bondage.
 
 Now it came to pass that Alma and his people in the
 night-time gathered their flocks together, and also of their
 grain; yea, even all the night-time were they gathering the
 flocks together.
 
 And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon
 the Lamanites, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound
 sleep.
 
 And Alma and his people departed into the wilderness; and
 when they had traveled all day they pitched their tents in a
 valley, and they called the valley Alma, because he led their way
 in the wilderness.
 
 Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their thanks
 to God because he had been merciful unto them, and eased their
 burdens, and had delivered them out of bondage; for they were in
 bondage, and none could deliver them except it were the Lord
 their God.
 
 And they gave thanks to God, yea, all their men and all their
 women and all their children that could speak lifted their voices
 in the praises of their God.
 
 And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and get thou and
 this people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and
 do pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will
 stop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in
 pursuit of this people.
 
 And it came to pass that they departed out of the valley, and
 took their journey into the wilderness.
 
 And after they had been in the wilderness twelve days they
 arrived in the land of Zarahemla; and king Mosiah did also
 receive them with joy.
 
 
 And now king Mosiah caused that all the people should be
 gathered together.
 
 Now there were not so many of the children of Nephi, or so
 many of those who were descendants of Nephi, as there were of the
 people of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who
 came with him into the wilderness.
 
 And there were not so many of the people of Nephi and of the
 people of Zarahemla as there were of the Lamanites; yea, they
 were not half so numerous.
 
 And now all the people of Nephi were assembled together, and
 also all the people of Zarahemla, and they were gathered together
 in two bodies.
 
 And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be
 read, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the
 records of the people of Zeniff, from the time they left the land
 of Zarahemla until they returned again.
 
 And he also read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all
 their afflictions, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla
 until the time they returned again.
 
 And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading the records,
 his people who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and
 amazement.
 
 For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those
 that had been delivered out of bondage they were filled with
 exceedingly great joy.
 
 And again, when they thought of their brethren who had been
 slain by the Lamanites they were filled with sorrow, and even
 shed many tears of sorrow.
 
 And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of
 God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the
 hands of the Lamanites and of bondage, they did raise their
 voices and give thanks to God.
 
 And again, when they thought upon the Lamanites, who were
 their brethren, of their sinful and polluted state, they were
 filled with pain and anguish for the welfare of their souls.
 
 And it came to pass that those who were the children of
 Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the daughters of
 the Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers,
 and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers,
 therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they
 might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those
 who were called Nephites.
 
 And now all the people of Zarahemla were numbered with the
 Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon
 none but those who were descendants of Nephi.
 
 And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of
 speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should
 also speak to the people.
 
 And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled
 together in large bodies, and he went from one body to another,
 preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord.
 
 And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all
 those that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should
 remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them.
 
 And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people
 many things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king
 Limhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people
 were desirous that they might be baptized also.
 
 Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize
 them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his
 brethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did
 baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of
 their belief on the words of Alma.
 
 And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that
 he might establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla;
 and gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every
 church.
 
 Now this was done because there were so many people that they
 could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all
 hear the word of God in one assembly;
 
 Therefore they did assemble themselves together in different
 bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests
 and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according
 as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.
 
 And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were
 all one church, yea, even the church of God; for there was
 nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance
 and faith in God.
 
 And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla.
 And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon
 them the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of
 God;
 
 And they were called the people of God. And the Lord did
 pour out his Spirit upon them, and they were blessed, and
 prospered in the land.
 
 
 Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising
 generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin,
 being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and
 they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.
 
 They did not believe what had been said concerning the
 resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the
 coming of Christ.
 
 And now because of their unbelief they could not understand
 the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.
 
 And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the
 church. And they were a separate people as to their faith, and
 remained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state;
 for they would not call upon the Lord their God.
 
 And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous
 as the people of God; but because of the dissensions among the
 brethren they became more numerous.
 
 For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their
 flattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to
 commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who
 committed sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by
 the church.
 
 And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests,
 and delivered up unto the priests by the teachers; and the
 priests brought them before Alma, who was the high priest.
 
 Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the church.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma did not know concerning them;
 but there were many witnesses against them; yea, the people stood
 and testified of their iniquity in abundance.
 
 Now there had not any such thing happened before in the
 church; therefore Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused
 that they should be brought before the king.
 
 And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have
 brought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and
 they have been taken in divers iniquities. And they do not
 repent of their iniquities; therefore we have brought them before
 thee, that thou mayest judge them according to their crimes.
 
 But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge them not;
 therefore I deliver them into thy hands to be judged.
 
 And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went
 and inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this
 matter, for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of
 God.
 
 And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole
 soul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:
 
 Blessed art thou, Alma, and blessed are they who were
 baptized in the waters of Mormon. Thou art blessed because of
 thy exceeding faith in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.
 
 And blessed are they because of their exceeding faith in the
 words alone which thou hast spoken unto them.
 
 And blessed art thou because thou hast established a church
 among this people; and they shall be established, and they shall
 be my people.
 
 Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name;
 for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.
 
 And because thou hast inquired of me concerning the
 transgressor, thou art blessed.
 
 Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt
 have eternal life; and thou shalt serve me and go forth in my
 name, and shalt gather together my sheep.
 
 And he that will hear my voice shall be my sheep; and him
 shall ye receive into the church, and him will I also receive.
 
 For behold, this is my church; whosoever is baptized shall be
 baptized unto repentance. And whomsoever ye receive shall
 believe in my name; and him will I freely forgive.
 
 For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it
 is I that hath created them; and it is I that granteth unto him
 that believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.
 
 For behold, in my name are they called; and if they know me
 they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my
 right hand.
 
 And it shall come to pass that when the second trump shall
 sound then shall they that never knew me come forth and shall
 stand before me.
 
 And then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, that I
 am their Redeemer; but they would not be redeemed.
 
 And then I will confess unto them that I never knew them; and
 they shall depart into everlasting fire prepared for the devil
 and his angels.
 
 Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my
 voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I
 will not receive at the last day.
 
 Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth
 against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has
 committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and
 repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive,
 and I will forgive him also.
 
 Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them
 their trespasses against me.
 
 And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses; for
 verily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor's
 trespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought
 himself under condemnation.
 
 Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not repent of his
 sins the same shall not be numbered among my people; and this
 shall be observed from this time forward.
 
 And it came to pass when Alma had heard these words he wrote
 them down that he might have them, and that he might judge the
 people of that church according to the commandments of God.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma went and judged those that had
 been taken in iniquity, according to the word of the Lord.
 
 And whosoever repented of their sins and did confess them,
 them he did number among the people of the church;
 
 And those that would not confess their sins and repent of
 their iniquity, the same were not numbered among the people of
 the church, and their names were blotted out.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of
 the church; and they began again to have peace and to prosper
 exceedingly in the affairs of the church, walking circumspectly
 before God, receiving many, and baptizing many.
 
 And now all these things did Alma and his fellow laborers do
 who were over the church, walking in all diligence, teaching the
 word of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions,
 being persecuted by all those who did not belong to the church of
 God.
 
 And they did admonish their brethren; and they were also
 admonished, every one by the word of God, according to his sins,
 or to the sins which he had committed, being commanded of God to
 pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that the persecutions which were
 inflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that
 the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders
 concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma. And Alma
 laid the case before their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah consulted
 with his priests.
 
 And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation
 throughout the land round about that there should not any
 unbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of
 God.
 
 And there was a strict command throughout all the churches
 that there should be no persecutions among them, that there
 should be an equality among all men;
 
 That they should let no pride nor haughtiness disturb their
 peace; that every man should esteem his neighbor as himself,
 laboring with their own hands for their support.
 
 Yea, and all their priests and teachers should labor with
 their own hands for their support, in all cases save it were in
 sickness, or in much want; and doing these things, they did
 abound in the grace of God.
 
 And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the
 people began to be very numerous, and began to scatter abroad
 upon the face of the earth, yea, on the north and on the south,
 on the east and on the west, building large cities and villages
 in all quarters of the land.
 
 And the Lord did visit them and prosper them, and they became
 a large and wealthy people.
 
 Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers;
 and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he
 being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a
 very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many
 words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he
 led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.
 
 And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the
 church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing
 much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy
 of God to exercise his power over them.
 
 And now it came to pass that while he was going about to
 destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the
 sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray
 the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or
 even the king--
 
 And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling
 against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them;
 and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were
 with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon
 which they stood;
 
 And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the
 earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.
 
 Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand
 forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord
 hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and
 nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my
 people.
 
 And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the
 prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma,
 who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning
 thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth;
 therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the
 power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants
 might be answered according to their faith.
 
 And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God? For behold,
 doth not my voice shake the earth? And can ye not also behold me
 before you? And I am sent from God.
 
 Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy
 fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and
 remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in
 bondage, and he has delivered them. And now I say unto thee,
 Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that
 their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of
 thyself be cast off.
 
 And now it came to pass that these were the last words which
 the angel spake unto Alma, and he departed.
 
 And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the
 earth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes
 they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as
 thunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was
 nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and
 cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.
 
 And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became
 dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak,
 even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by
 those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was
 laid before his father.
 
 And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto
 them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power
 of God.
 
 And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together
 that they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and
 also for those that were with him.
 
 And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves
 together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their
 God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak,
 and also that his limbs might receive their strength--that the
 eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the
 goodness and glory of God.
 
 And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the
 space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received
 their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them,
 bidding them to be of good comfort:
 
 For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been
 redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.
 
 And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea,
 men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be
 born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and
 fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God,
 becoming his sons and daughters;
 
 And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this,
 they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.
 
 I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast
 off; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.
 
 Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulations,
 repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to
 snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.
 
 My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and
 bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold
 the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal
 torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.
 
 I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken
 of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will
 come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he
 will make himself manifest unto all.
 
 Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before
 him. Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be
 judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall
 they confess, who live without God in the world, that the
 judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they
 shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his
 all-searching eye.
 
 And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time
 forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the
 time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through
 all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they
 had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much
 tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were
 unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.
 
 But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much
 consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting
 them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the
 commandments of God.
 
 And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names
 were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names
 of the sons of Mosiah.
 
 And they traveled throughout all the lands of Zarahemla, and
 among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah,
 zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done
 to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the
 things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the
 scriptures to all who desired to hear them.
 
 And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in
 bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the
 knowledge of their Redeemer.
 
 And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they
 did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the
 people that the Lord reigneth.
 
 
 Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all
 these things, they took a small number with them and returned to
 their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant
 unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go
 up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which
 they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to
 their brethren, the Lamanites--
 
 That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the
 Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their
 fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred
 towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice
 in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one
 another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the
 land which the Lord their God had given them.
 
 Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to
 every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul
 should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should
 endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.
 
 And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they
 were the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his
 infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much
 anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and
 fearing that they should be cast off forever.
 
 And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many
 days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.
 
 And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let
 his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.
 
 And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall
 believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I
 will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.
 
 And it came to pass that Mosiah granted that they might go and
 do according to their request.
 
 And they took their journey into the wilderness to go up to
 preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an account
 of their proceedings hereafter.
 
 Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for
 there was not any of his sons who would accept of the kingdom.
 
 Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the
 plates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and all the things
 which he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of
 God, after having translated and caused to be written the records
 which were on the plates of gold which had been found by the
 people of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of
 Limhi;
 
 And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people;
 for they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those
 people who had been destroyed.
 
 And now he translated them by the means of those two stones
 which were fastened into the two rims of a bow.
 
 Now these things were prepared from the beginning, and were
 handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of
 interpreting languages;
 
 And they have been kept and preserved by the hand of the
 Lord, that he should discover to every creature who should
 possess the land the iniquities and abominations of his people;
 
 And whosoever has these things is called seer, after the
 manner of old times.
 
 Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records,
 behold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from
 the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the
 great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the
 people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the
 earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of
 Adam.
 
 Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn
 exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it
 gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.
 
 And this account shall be written hereafter; for behold, it
 is expedient that all people should know the things which are
 written in this account.
 
 And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done
 these things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things
 which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son
 of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and
 conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep
 and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing
 them down from one generation to another, even as they had been
 handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.
 
 
 Now when Mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the
 land, among all the people, desiring to know their will
 concerning who should be their king.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying:
 We are desirous that Aaron thy son should be our king and our
 ruler.
 
 Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king
 could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take
 upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the sons of Mosiah
 willing to take upon them the kingdom.
 
 Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the people; yea, even a
 written word sent he among the people. And these were the words
 that were written, saying:
 
 Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren, for I esteem you as
 such, I desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are
 called to consider--for ye are desirous to have a king.
 
 Now I declare unto you that he to whom the kingdom doth
 rightly belong has declined, and will not take upon him the
 kingdom.
 
 And now if there should be another appointed in his stead,
 behold I fear there would rise contentions among you. And who
 knoweth but what my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should
 turn to be angry and draw away a part of this people after him,
 which would cause wars and contentions among you, which would be
 the cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the
 Lord, yea, and destroy the souls of many people.
 
 Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider these things,
 for we have no right to destroy my son, neither should we have
 any right to destroy another if he should be appointed in his
 stead.
 
 And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things
 he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right
 to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to
 commit much sin.
 
 And now let us be wise and look forward to these things, and
 do that which will make for the peace of this people.
 
 Therefore I will be your king the remainder of my days;
 nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this people
 according to our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of
 this people, for we will appoint wise men to be judges, that will
 judge this people according to the commandments of God.
 
 Now it is better that a man should be judged of God than of
 man, for the judgments of God are always just, but the judgments
 of man are not always just.
 
 Therefore, if it were possible that you could have just men
 to be your kings, who would establish the laws of God, and judge
 this people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have
 men for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did
 for this people--I say unto you, if this could always be the case
 then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to
 rule over you.
 
 And even I myself have labored with all the power and
 faculties which I have possessed, to teach you the commandments
 of God, and to establish peace throughout the land, that there
 should be no wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering,
 nor murdering, nor any manner of iniquity;
 
 And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have I punished
 according to the crime which he has committed, according to the
 law which has been given to us by our fathers.
 
 Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is
 not expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over
 you.
 
 For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked king cause to
 be committed, yea, and what great destruction!
 
 Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations,
 and also the wickedness and abominations of his people. Behold
 what great destruction did come upon them; and also because of
 their iniquities they were brought into bondage.
 
 And were it not for the interposition of their all-wise
 Creator, and this because of their sincere repentance, they must
 unavoidably remain in bondage until now.
 
 But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble
 themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him
 he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work
 with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending
 the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.
 
 And behold, now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an
 iniquitous king save it be through much contention, and the
 shedding of much blood.
 
 For behold, he has his friends in iniquity, and he keepeth
 his guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of those who
 have reigned in righteousness before him; and he trampleth under
 his feet the commandments of God;
 
 And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his
 people, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and
 whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and
 whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against
 them to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an
 unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.
 
 And now behold I say unto you, it is not expedient that such
 abominations should come upon you.
 
 Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges,
 that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given
 you by our fathers, which are correct, and which were given them
 by the hand of the Lord.
 
 Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth
 anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for
 the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right;
 therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law--to do your
 business by the voice of the people.
 
 And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth
 choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will
 come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great
 destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.
 
 And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you
 according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they
 may be judged of a higher judge.
 
 If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye
 shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be
 gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges,
 according to the voice of the people.
 
 And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord;
 and I command you to do these things, and that ye have no king;
 that if these people commit sins and iniquities they shall be
 answered upon their own heads.
 
 For behold I say unto you, the sins of many people have been
 caused by the iniquities of their kings; therefore their
 iniquities are answered upon the heads of their kings.
 
 And now I desire that this inequality should be no more in
 this land, especially among this my people; but I desire that
 this land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his
 rights and privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we
 may live and inherit the land, yea, even as long as any of our
 posterity remains upon the face of the land.
 
 And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them,
 unfolding unto them all the trials and troubles of a righteous
 king, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also
 all the murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained
 it all unto them.
 
 And he told them that these things ought not to be; but that
 the burden should come upon all the people, that every man might
 bear his part.
 
 And he also unfolded unto them all the disadvantages they
 labored under, by having an unrighteous king to rule over them;
 
 Yea, all his iniquities and abominations, and all the wars,
 and contentions, and bloodshed, and the stealing, and the
 plundering, and the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of
 iniquities which cannot be enumerated--telling them that these
 things ought not to be, that they were expressly repugnant to the
 commandments of God.
 
 And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had sent these
 things forth among the people they were convinced of the truth of
 his words.
 
 Therefore they relinquished their desires for a king, and
 became exceedingly anxious that every man should have an equal
 chance throughout all the land; yea, and every man expressed a
 willingness to answer for his own sins.
 
 Therefore, it came to pass that they assembled themselves
 together in bodies throughout the land, to cast in their voices
 concerning who should be their judges, to judge them according to
 the law which had been given them; and they were exceedingly
 rejoiced because of the liberty which had been granted unto them.
 
 And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did
 esteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon
 him as a tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre
 which doth corrupt the soul; for he had not exacted riches of
 them, neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but he
 had established peace in the land, and he had granted unto his
 people that they should be delivered from all manner of bondage;
 therefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure.
 
 And it came to pass that they did appoint judges to rule over
 them, or to judge them according to the law; and this they did
 throughout all the land.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the first
 chief judge, he being also the high priest, his father having
 conferred the office upon him, and having given him the charge
 concerning all the affairs of the church.
 
 And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the ways of the
 Lord, and he did keep his commandments, and he did judge
 righteous judgments; and there was continual peace through the
 land.
 
 And thus commenced the reign of the judges throughout all the
 land of Zarahemla, among all the people who were called the
 Nephites; and Alma was the first and chief judge.
 
 And now it came to pass that his father died, being eighty
 and two years old, having lived to fulfil the commandments of
 God.
 
 And it came to pass that Mosiah died also, in the thirty and
 third year of his reign, being sixty and three years old; making
 in the whole, five hundred and nine years from the time Lehi left
 Jerusalem.
 
 And thus ended the reign of the kings over the people of
 Nephi; and thus ended the days of Alma, who was the founder of
 their church.
 
 Alma
 THE BOOK OF ALMA
 THE SON OF ALMA
 The account of Alma, who was the son of Alma the first, and chief
 judge over the people of Nephi, and also the high priest over the
 Church. An account of the reign of the judges, and the wars and
 contentions among the people. And also an account of a war
 between the Nephites and the Lamanites, according to the record
 of Alma, the first and chief judge.
 
 
 Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the
 judges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king
 Mosiah having gone the way of all the earth, having warred a good
 warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in
 his stead; nevertheless he had established laws, and they were
 acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide
 by the laws which he had made.
 
 And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of
 Alma in the judgment-seat, there was a man brought before him to
 be judged, a man who was large, and was noted for his much
 strength.
 
 And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that
 which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the
 church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher
 ought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their
 hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.
 
 And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should
 be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor
 tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for
 the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and,
 in the end, all men should have eternal life.
 
 And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much
 that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began
 to support him and give him money.
 
 And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to
 wear very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a
 church after the manner of his preaching.
 
 And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who
 believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of
 God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to contend
 with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the
 church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words
 of God.
 
 Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an
 instrument in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi
 out of bondage.
 
 Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was
 wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him.
 Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not
 able to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.
 
 And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the
 church, and was brought before Alma, to be judged according to
 the crimes which he had committed.
 
 And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pleaded for
 himself with much boldness.
 
 But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that
 priestcraft has been introduced among this people. And behold,
 thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to
 enforce it by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced
 among this people it would prove their entire destruction.
 
 And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man
 who has done much good among this people; and were we to spare
 thee his blood would come upon us for vengeance.
 
 Therefore thou art condemned to die, according to the law
 which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been
 acknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by
 the law.
 
 And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was
 Nehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and
 there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the
 heavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was
 contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious
 death.
 
 Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of
 priestcraft through the land; for there were many who loved the
 vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false
 doctrines; and this they did for the sake of riches and honor.
 
 Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear
 of the law, for liars were punished; therefore they pretended to
 preach according to their belief; and now the law could have no
 power on any man for his belief.
 
 And they durst not steal, for fear of the law, for such were
 punished; neither durst they rob, nor murder, for he that
 murdered was punished unto death.
 
 But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the
 church of God began to persecute those that did belong to the
 church of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.
 
 Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all
 manner of words, and this because of their humility; because they
 were not proud in their own eyes, and because they did impart the
 word of God, one with another, without money and without price.
 
 Now there was a strict law among the people of the church
 that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and
 persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there
 should be no persecution among themselves.
 
 Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be
 proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even
 unto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their fists.
 
 Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it
 was a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the
 cause of much trial with the church.
 
 For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were
 blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people
 of God. And also many withdrew themselves from among them.
 
 Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in
 the faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in
 keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the
 persecution which was heaped upon them.
 
 And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of
 God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear
 the word of God. And when the priest had imparted unto them the
 word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors;
 and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the
 preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher
 any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and
 they did all labor, every man according to his strength.
 
 And they did impart of their substance, every man according
 to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick,
 and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they
 were neat and comely.
 
 And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and
 thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding
 all their persecutions.
 
 And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began
 to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever
 they stood in need--an abundance of flocks and herds, and
 fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold,
 and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and
 fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.
 
 And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not
 send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were
 athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and
 they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were
 liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male
 and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no
 respect to persons as to those who stood in need.
 
 And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than
 those who did not belong to their church.
 
 For those who did not belong to their church did indulge
 themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in
 babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel;
 being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting,
 lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering,
 and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in
 force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was
 possible.
 
 And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon
 them, every man suffering according to that which he had done,
 they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it
 were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of
 Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.
 
 
 And it came to pass in the commencement of the fifth year of
 their reign there began to be a contention among the people; for
 a certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man,
 yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the
 order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed
 according to the law--
 
 Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people
 after him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and
 they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be king over the
 people.
 
 Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to
 all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of
 Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such
 things must be established by the voice of the people.
 
 Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the
 voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them
 of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his
 intent to destroy the church of God.
 
 And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves
 together throughout all the land, every man according to his
 mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies,
 having much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another.
 
 And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in
 their voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the
 judges.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against
 Amlici, that he was not made king over the people.
 
 Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were
 against him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor
 to anger against those who were not in his favor.
 
 And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together,
 and did consecrate Amlici to be their king.
 
 Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them
 that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he
 did that he might subject them to him.
 
 Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of
 Amlici, being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called
 Nephites, or the people of God.
 
 Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent
 of the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them;
 yea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and
 with bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and
 with all manner of weapons of war, of every kind.
 
 And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time
 of their coming. And there were appointed captains, and higher
 captains, and chief captains, according to their numbers.
 
 And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all
 manner of weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed
 rulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against
 their brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill
 Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land
 of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites.
 
 Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the
 people of Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with
 his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies,
 against the Amlicites to battle.
 
 And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of
 Sidon. And the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with
 great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall
 before the Amlicites.
 
 Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the
 Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that
 they began to flee before them.
 
 And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the
 Amlicites all that day, and did slay them with much slaughter,
 insomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand
 five hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the
 Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.
 
 And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites
 no longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in
 the valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon
 who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this
 valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night.
 
 And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites,
 that he might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he
 might guard himself against them, that he might preserve his
 people from being destroyed.
 
 Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the
 Amlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher;
 these were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of
 the Amlicites.
 
 And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the
 camp of the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished,
 and struck with much fear, saying:
 
 Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our
 great astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of
 Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous
 host of the Lamanites; and behold, the Amlicites have joined
 them;
 
 And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are
 fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their
 children, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain
 possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our
 children be slain.
 
 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their
 tents, and departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their
 city, which was the city of Zarahemla.
 
 And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the
 Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it
 were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them.
 
 Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of
 the Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver
 them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did
 hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and
 the Amlicites did fall before them.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the
 sword, face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with
 another.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, being
 exercised with much faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and
 spare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save
 and preserve this people.
 
 Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with
 Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici
 with the sword.
 
 And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the
 king of the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his
 guards to contend with Alma.
 
 But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the
 king of the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back.
 
 And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was
 on the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the
 Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that
 thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the
 Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon.
 
 And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river
 Sidon that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before
 them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not
 be numbered.
 
 And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness
 which was west and north, away beyond the borders of the land;
 and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay
 them.
 
 Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until
 they were scattered on the west, and on the north, until they had
 reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was
 that part of the wilderness which was infested by wild and
 ravenous beasts.
 
 And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their
 wounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures
 of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped
 up on the earth.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the Nephites who were not slain by
 the weapons of war, after having buried those who had been
 slain--now the number of the slain were not numbered, because of
 the greatness of their number--after they had finished burying
 their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses,
 and their wives, and their children.
 
 Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and
 also many of their flocks and their herds; and also many of their
 fields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the
 hosts of men.
 
 And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had
 been slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the
 waters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the
 sea, and they are many.
 
 And the Amlicites were distinguished from the Nephites, for
 they had marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the
 manner of the Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their
 heads like unto the Lamanites.
 
 Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were
 naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and
 also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows,
 and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so
 forth.
 
 And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the
 mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon
 them because of their transgression and their rebellion against
 their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and
 Sam, who were just and holy men.
 
 And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were
 cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman
 and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.
 
 And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from
 the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might
 preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in
 incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.
 
 And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with
 that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.
 
 Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the
 Lamanites was called under that head, and there was a mark set
 upon him.
 
 And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the
 tradition of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were
 brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition
 of their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the
 commandments of God and kept them, were called the Nephites, or
 the people of Nephi, from that time forth--
 
 And it is they who have kept the records which are true of
 their people, and also of the people of the Lamanites.
 
 Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had
 a mark set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves,
 yea, even a mark of red upon their foreheads.
 
 Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words
 which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and
 I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be
 separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and
 forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me
 that I may have mercy upon them.
 
 And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed
 with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.
 
 And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against
 thee and thy seed.
 
 And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be
 called thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be
 called thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the
 promises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed.
 
 Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the
 words of God when they began to mark themselves in their
 foreheads; nevertheless they had come out in open rebellion
 against God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should
 fall upon them.
 
 Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon
 themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed
 bring upon himself his own condemnation.
 
 Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which
 was fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the
 Amlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in
 upon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army
 met the Amlicites.
 
 And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them
 out of their land.
 
 Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up
 to battle at this time against the Lamanites;
 
 But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up
 and slew many of the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them
 out of the borders of their land.
 
 And then they returned again and began to establish peace in
 the land, being troubled no more for a time with their enemies.
 
 Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and
 contentions were commenced and ended in the fifth year of the
 reign of the judges.
 
 And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls
 sent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards
 according to their works, whether they were good or whether they
 were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery, according
 to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good
 spirit or a bad one.
 
 For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey,
 and this according to the words of the spirit of prophecy;
 therefore let it be according to the truth. And thus endeth the
 fifth year of the reign of the judges.
 
 
 Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the
 judges over the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor
 wars in the land of Zarahemla;
 
 But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the
 loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and
 herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were
 trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.
 
 And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause
 to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent
 upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations;
 therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.
 
 And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and
 many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the
 church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who
 had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the
 church, by the hand of his father Alma.
 
 And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the
 judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that
 united themselves to the church of God and were baptized. And
 thus endeth the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the
 people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.
 
 And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the
 judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because
 of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their
 fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds,
 and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious
 things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all
 these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for
 they began to wear very costly apparel.
 
 Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to
 many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and
 priests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were
 sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be
 among their people.
 
 For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of
 the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and
 to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the
 world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and
 they began to persecute those that did not believe according to
 their own will and pleasure.
 
 And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges,
 there began to be great contentions among the people of the
 church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and
 persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who
 did not belong to the church of God.
 
 And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges;
 and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to
 those who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began
 to fail in its progress.
 
 And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year,
 Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the
 example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on
 from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the
 destruction of the people.
 
 Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting
 themselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their
 backs upon the needy and the naked and those who were hungry, and
 those who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted.
 
 Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people,
 while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood
 in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the
 poor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner
 of afflictions, for Christ's sake, who should come according to
 the spirit of prophecy;
 
 Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of
 their sins; being filled with great joy because of the
 resurrection of the dead, according to the will and power and
 deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.
 
 And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the
 afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions
 which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and
 seeing all their inequality, began to be very sorrowful;
 nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.
 
 And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the
 church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people,
 that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws
 which had been given, and to put them in force according to the
 wickedness and the crimes of the people.
 
 Now this man's name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief
 judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the
 people.
 
 Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high
 priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest
 unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.
 
 And this he did that he himself might go forth among his
 people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the
 word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their
 duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the
 pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his
 people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in
 bearing down in pure testimony against them.
 
 And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign
 of the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the
 judgment-seat to Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the
 high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the
 word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy.
 
 
 Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God
 unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence
 throughout all the land.
 
 And these are the words which he spake to the people in the
 church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according
 to his own record, saying:
 
 I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a
 high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority
 from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began
 to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of
 Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea,
 and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.
 
 And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the
 hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.
 
 And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the
 hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you,
 they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out
 of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into
 this land, and here we began to establish the church of God
 throughout this land also.
 
 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong
 to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the
 captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently
 retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards
 them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance
 that he has delivered their souls from hell?
 
 Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of
 a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the
 midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by
 the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about
 by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting
 destruction did await them.
 
 And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed?
 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they were not.
 
 And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the
 chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed? I
 say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand,
 and they did sing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they
 are saved.
 
 And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea,
 what grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the cause
 of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the
 chains of hell?
 
 Behold, I can tell you--did not my father Alma believe in the
 words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he
 not a holy prophet? Did he not speak the words of God, and my
 father Alma believe them?
 
 And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought
 in his heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.
 
 And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a
 mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled
 themselves and put their trust in the true and living God. And
 behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were
 saved.
 
 And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have
 ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in
 your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in
 your hearts?
 
 Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created
 you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this
 mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in
 incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the
 deeds which have been done in the mortal body?
 
 I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear
 the voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me
 ye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of
 righteousness upon the face of the earth?
 
 Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord
 in that day, and say--Lord, our works have been righteous works
 upon the face of the earth--and that he will save you?
 
 Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the
 tribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse,
 having a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect
 remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye
 have set at defiance the commandments of God?
 
 I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure
 heart and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, having
 the image of God engraven upon your countenances?
 
 I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have
 yielded yourselves to become subjects to the devil?
 
 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be
 saved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are
 washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are
 cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has
 been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people
 from their sins.
 
 And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel,
 if ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments
 stained with blood and all manner of filthiness? Behold, what
 will these things testify against you?
 
 Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and
 also that ye are guilty of all manner of wickedness?
 
 Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have
 a place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with
 Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose
 garments are cleansed and are spotless, pure and white?
 
 I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from
 the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning,
 ye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of
 heaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the children of
 the kingdom of the devil.
 
 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have
 experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the
 song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?
 
 Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God?
 Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within
 yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your
 garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of
 Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?
 
 Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are
 not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare
 quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an
 one hath not eternal life.
 
 Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of
 envy? I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I
 would that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at
 hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an
 one is not found guiltless.
 
 And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth
 make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him
 persecutions?
 
 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is
 at hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!
 
 Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent,
 for the Lord God hath spoken it!
 
 Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms
 of mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I
 will receive you.
 
 Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit
 of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and
 the waters of life freely;
 
 Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and
 ye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire--
 
 For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth
 not good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of
 righteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.
 
 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain
 things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the
 ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep
 having no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after
 you and is still calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto
 his voice!
 
 Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you;
 yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of
 Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good
 shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not
 the sheep of the good shepherd.
 
 And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what
 fold are ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your
 shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this?
 Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a
 child of the devil.
 
 For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God,
 and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.
 
 Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth
 unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but
 whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of
 the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.
 
 And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him;
 therefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to things
 pertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.
 
 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I
 speak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto
 you plainly that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the
 commandments of God.
 
 For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the
 holy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded
 to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been
 spoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come.
 
 And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I know of these
 things myself? Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that
 these things whereof I have spoken are true. And how do ye
 suppose that I know of their surety?
 
 Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the
 Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days
 that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of
 myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them
 manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of
 revelation which is in me.
 
 And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed
 unto me, that the words which have been spoken by our fathers are
 true, even so according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me,
 which is also by the manifestation of the Spirit of God.
 
 I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall
 say unto you, concerning that which is to come, is true; and I
 say unto you, that I know that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the
 Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy,
 and truth. And behold, it is he that cometh to take away the
 sins of the world, yea, the sins of every man who steadfastly
 believeth on his name.
 
 And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I
 am called, yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and
 every one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all,
 both old and young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the
 aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation; yea,
 to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.
 
 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth,
 for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God
 cometh in his glory, in his might, majesty, power, and dominion.
 Yea, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit saith:
 Behold the glory of the King of all the earth; and also the King
 of heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of
 men.
 
 And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a
 mighty voice, saying: Go forth and say unto this people--Repent,
 for except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of
 heaven.
 
 And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is
 laid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth
 not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire,
 yea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire.
 Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.
 
 And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand
 these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and trample
 the Holy One under your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the
 pride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing
 of costly apparel and setting your hearts upon the vain things of
 the world, upon your riches?
 
 Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than
 another; yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your
 brethren, who humble themselves and do walk after the holy order
 of God, wherewith they have been brought into this church, having
 been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth works
 which are meet for repentance--
 
 Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the
 poor, and the needy, and in withholding your substance from them?
 
 And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I
 say unto you that these are they who shall be hewn down and cast
 into the fire except they speedily repent.
 
 And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow
 the voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and
 be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold,
 their names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked
 shall not be numbered among the names of the righteous, that the
 word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the
 wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;
 
 For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book
 of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right
 hand. And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this? I
 say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the
 word of God must be fulfilled.
 
 For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth
 not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his
 flock? And behold, if a wolf enter his flock doth he not drive
 him out? Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.
 
 And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after
 you; and if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you
 into his fold, and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that
 ye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may not be
 destroyed.
 
 And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who
 hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have
 spoken unto you.
 
 I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church;
 and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of
 invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye
 also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of
 speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in
 the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying
 on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch
 over the church.
 
 And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the
 church who repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance,
 and were received into the church.
 
 And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the
 church that did not repent of their wickedness and humble
 themselves before God--I mean those who were lifted up in the
 pride of their hearts--the same were rejected, and their names
 were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those
 of the righteous.
 
 And thus they began to establish the order of the church in
 the city of Zarahemla.
 
 Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was
 liberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of
 assembling themselves together to hear the word of God.
 
 Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they
 should gather themselves together oft, and join in fasting and
 mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who
 knew not God.
 
 And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these
 regulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was
 in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the
 river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city
 built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the
 valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was
 slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.
 
 And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the
 church which was established in the valley of Gideon, according
 to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken
 by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was
 in him, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of
 God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and
 the holy order by which he was called. And thus it is written.
 Amen.
 
 
 Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted
 to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my
 language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time
 that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having
 been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much
 business that I could not come unto you.
 
 And even I could not have come now at this time were it not
 that the judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my
 stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come
 unto you.
 
 And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire
 that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and
 that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I
 should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find
 that ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in
 at Zarahemla.
 
 But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know,
 yea, hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that
 they are established again in the way of his righteousness.
 
 And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me,
 that I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire
 that my joy over you should come by the cause of so much
 afflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren at
 Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading
 through much affliction and sorrow.
 
 But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much
 unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up
 in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set
 your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I
 trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the
 true and living God, and that ye look forward for the remission
 of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.
 
 For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and
 behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they
 all--for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer
 liveth and cometh among his people.
 
 Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of
 his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit
 hath not said unto me that this should be the case. Now as to
 this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord
 God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.
 
 But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying:
 Cry unto this people, saying--Repent ye, and prepare the way of
 the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold,
 the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon
 the face of the earth.
 
 And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is
 the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and
 chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the
 power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son
 of God.
 
 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and
 temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be
 fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the
 sicknesses of his people.
 
 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands
 of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their
 infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according
 to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to
 succor his people according to their infirmities.
 
 Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of
 God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him
 the sins of his people, that he might blot out their
 transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now
 behold, this is the testimony which is in me.
 
 Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again;
 for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit
 the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto
 repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may
 have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the
 world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all
 unrighteousness.
 
 Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every
 sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to
 destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that
 ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant
 with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this
 day by going into the waters of baptism.
 
 And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God
 from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him,
 yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have
 eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit,
 which testifieth in me.
 
 And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things?
 Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the
 way that I know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of
 the Spirit which is in me. And now because your faith is strong
 concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken,
 great is my joy.
 
 For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much
 desire that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your
 brethren, even so I have found that my desires have been
 gratified.
 
 For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I
 perceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of
 God; yea, I perceive that ye are making his paths straight.
 
 I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the
 testimony of his word, that he cannot walk in crooked paths;
 neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath
 he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that
 which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is
 one eternal round.
 
 And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can
 filthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the
 kingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come,
 yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is filthy shall
 remain in his filthiness.
 
 And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto
 you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that
 ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy
 order of God, after which ye have been received.
 
 And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive
 and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and
 long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in
 keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for
 whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal;
 always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do
 receive.
 
 And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye
 will always abound in good works.
 
 And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless,
 that ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac,
 and Jacob, and the holy prophets who have been ever since the
 world began, having your garments spotless even as their garments
 are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no more out.
 
 And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto
 you according to the Spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul
 doth exceedingly rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and
 heed which ye have given unto my word.
 
 And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your
 houses and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that
 you possess, your women and your children, according to your
 faith and good works, from this time forth and forever. And thus
 I have spoken. Amen.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of
 Gideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things
 which cannot be written, having established the order of the
 church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla,
 yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself
 from the labors which he had performed.
 
 And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over
 the people of Nephi.
 
 And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of
 the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma
 departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of
 Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders
 of the wilderness.
 
 And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek
 according to the holy order of God, by which he had been called;
 and he began to teach the people throughout all the land of
 Melek.
 
 And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all
 the borders of the land which was by the wilderness side. And
 they were baptized throughout all the land;
 
 So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed
 thence, and traveled three days' journey on the north of the land
 of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah.
 
 Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their
 lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their
 small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them;
 and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.
 
 And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of
 Ammonihah he began to preach the word of God unto them.
 
 Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people
 of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto
 the words of Alma.
 
 Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with
 God in mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the
 people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he
 might baptize them unto repentance.
 
 Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him:
 Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art
 high priest over the church which thou hast established in many
 parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of
 thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.
 
 And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know
 that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the
 judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief
 judge over us.
 
 Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his
 words, and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he
 should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his
 journey towards the city which was called Aaron.
 
 And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither,
 being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation
 and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who
 were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was
 thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord
 appeared unto him, saying:
 
 Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and
 rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been
 faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which
 thou receivedst thy first message from him. Behold, I am he that
 delivered it unto you.
 
 And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the
 city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city;
 yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto them, except they repent
 the Lord God will destroy them.
 
 For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy
 the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is
 contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which
 he has given unto his people.
 
 Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message
 from the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of
 Ammonihah. And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the
 way which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah.
 
 And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to
 a man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?
 
 And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that
 thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an
 angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with
 me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I
 know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.
 
 And it came to pass that the man received him into his house;
 and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and
 meat and set before Alma.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and
 he blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.
 
 And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I
 am Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout
 the land.
 
 And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God
 among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and
 prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me,
 but they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this
 land forever.
 
 But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again
 and prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them
 concerning their iniquities.
 
 And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in,
 thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many
 days.
 
 And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to
 preach unto the people.
 
 And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in
 their iniquities.
 
 And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my
 servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people,
 saying--Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I
 will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my
 fierce anger away.
 
 And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to
 declare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the
 Holy Ghost.
 
 And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could
 not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man
 could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power
 until they were bound in bands and cast into prison. Now, this
 was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.
 
 And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach
 and to prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and
 power which the Lord had given them.
 
 
 And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should
 take Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or
 the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as
 I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me,
 saying:
 
 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony
 of one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth
 should pass away?
 
 Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they
 knew not that the earth should pass away.
 
 And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou
 shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one
 day.
 
 Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for
 they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.
 
 And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than
 one man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such
 great and marvelous things?
 
 And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold,
 they did not. And I stood with boldness to declare unto them,
 yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:
 
 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye
 forgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have
 forgotten the commandments of God.
 
 Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of
 Jerusalem by the hand of God? Do ye not remember that they were
 all led by him through the wilderness?
 
 And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our
 fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them
 from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?
 
 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his
 mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably
 have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this
 period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless
 misery and woe.
 
 Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent;
 and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of
 God. But behold, this is not all--he has commanded you to
 repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the
 earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce
 anger he will not turn away.
 
 Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto
 Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye
 shall prosper in the land? And again it is said that: Inasmuch
 as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the
 presence of the Lord.
 
 Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the
 Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been
 cut off from the presence of the Lord. Now we see that the word
 of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites
 have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their
 transgressions in the land.
 
 Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable
 for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in
 your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life
 than for you, except ye repent.
 
 For there are many promises which are extended to the
 Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers
 that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore
 the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence
 in the land.
 
 And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in
 his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of
 their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will
 be merciful unto all who call on his name.
 
 But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your
 wickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for
 the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they
 shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited
 with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce
 anger of the Lord.
 
 For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your
 iniquities, to destroy his people. I say unto you, Nay; he would
 rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who
 are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they
 could fall into sins and transgressions, after having had so much
 light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their
 God;
 
 Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the
 Lord; yea, after having been favored above every other nation,
 kindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made
 known unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and
 prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which is to
 come;
 
 Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed
 with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the
 Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of
 revelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with
 tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy
 Ghost, and the gift of translation;
 
 Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land
 of Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from
 famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every
 kind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not
 be destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time after time,
 and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been
 prospered until they are rich in all manner of things--
 
 And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have
 received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should
 transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do
 have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they
 should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable
 for the Lamanites than for them.
 
 For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the
 Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has
 not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye
 will rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from
 off the face of the earth?
 
 And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the
 Lord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring
 unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this
 people, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at
 hand;
 
 And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his
 glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of
 the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience,
 mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people
 and to answer their prayers.
 
 And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized
 unto repentance, through faith on his name.
 
 Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at
 hand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according
 to that which they have been--if they have been righteous they
 shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power
 and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they
 shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power
 and captivation of the devil.
 
 Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the
 people.
 
 And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye
 ought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are
 meet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly
 hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost
 and a fallen people.
 
 Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these
 words, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto
 them that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.
 
 And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a
 fallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their
 hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison.
 
 But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that
 they should take me at that time and cast me into prison.
 
 And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and
 began to preach unto them also. And now the words of Amulek are
 not all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in
 this book.
 
 
 Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people
 who were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:
 
 I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of
 Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was the same
 Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of
 the temple, which was written by the finger of God.
 
 And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of
 Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant
 of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by
 the hands of his brethren.
 
 And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all
 those who know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and
 friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my
 industry.
 
 Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the
 ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said
 I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake,
 for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power;
 yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.
 
 Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many
 times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these
 things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling
 against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth
 day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the
 reign of the judges.
 
 As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an
 angel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to
 thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea,
 a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many
 days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered,
 and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he
 shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord
 shall rest upon thee and thy house.
 
 And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and
 returned towards my house. And as I was going thither I found
 the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy
 house--and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto
 you concerning the things of God.
 
 And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know
 he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.
 
 And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified
 are true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth,
 even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto
 me; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house.
 
 For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me,
 and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk;
 yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the
 Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.
 
 And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began
 to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who
 testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of
 the things which were to come, according to the spirit of
 prophecy which was in them.
 
 Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to
 question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch
 them in their words, that they might find witness against them,
 that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be
 judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast
 into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear
 or witness against them.
 
 Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were
 lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer
 the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes
 of the people before the judges.
 
 Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of
 the people; and this was to enable them that they might be
 skilful in their profession.
 
 And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that
 thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the
 words which he should speak.
 
 Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs.
 But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived
 their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse
 generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the
 foundation of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to
 catch the holy ones of God.
 
 Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and
 to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter
 destruction of this people.
 
 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was
 about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon,
 causing that this people should be governed by their own
 voices--yea, well did he say that if the time should come that
 the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the
 time should come that this people should fall into transgression,
 they would be ripe for destruction.
 
 And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your
 iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of
 his angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at
 hand.
 
 Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I
 will come down among my people, with equity and justice in my
 hands.
 
 Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers
 of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now
 be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood,
 as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by
 famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.
 
 But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared;
 now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you
 then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he
 will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine,
 and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand
 except ye repent.
 
 And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with
 Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against
 our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have
 selected.
 
 But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier
 unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath
 Satan got such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield
 yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind
 your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are
 spoken, according to their truth?
 
 For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not
 understand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I
 have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your
 condemnation.
 
 And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the
 destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the
 unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges.
 
 And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these
 words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that
 this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for
 he hath spoken against our law. And now he says that he has not
 spoken against it.
 
 And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our
 judges.
 
 And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts
 that they should remember these things against him.
 
 And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he
 was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the
 most expert among them, having much business to do among the
 people.
 
 Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got
 gain according to their employ.
 
 
 Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge
 of the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should
 receive wages according to the time which they labored to judge
 those who were brought before them to be judged.
 
 Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he
 did owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge
 executed authority, and sent forth officers that the man should
 be brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law
 and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the
 man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or
 be cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber.
 
 And the judge received for his wages according to his time--a
 senine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to
 a senine of gold; and this is according to the law which was
 given.
 
 Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold,
 and of their silver, according to their value. And the names are
 given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner
 of the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after
 the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and
 their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of
 the people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges,
 they having been established by king Mosiah.
 
 Now the reckoning is thus--a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a
 shum of gold, and a limnah of gold.
 
 A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and
 an onti of silver.
 
 A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either
 for a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of
 grain.
 
 Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a
 senine.
 
 And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.
 
 And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.
 
 And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.
 
 And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.
 
 And an onti was as great as them all.
 
 Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their
 reckoning--
 
 A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a
 measure of barley.
 
 And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.
 
 And a leah is the half of a shiblum.
 
 Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.
 
 Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.
 
 Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they
 received their wages according to their employ, therefore, they
 did stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of
 disturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ,
 that they might get money according to the suits which were
 brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people
 against Alma and Amulek.
 
 And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye
 answer me a few questions which I shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was
 a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might
 destroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will
 ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?
 
 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the
 Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which
 is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto
 him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I
 give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.
 
 Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me?
 Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?
 
 Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto you, Nay,
 thou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more
 than him.
 
 And now thou hast lied before God unto me. Thou saidst unto
 me--Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will
 give unto thee--when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them
 from me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true
 and living God, that thou mightest have cause to destroy me. And
 now behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy reward.
 
 And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and
 living God?
 
 And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.
 
 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?
 
 And he answered, No.
 
 Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these
 things?
 
 And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me.
 
 And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come? Is it the
 Son of God?
 
 And he said unto him, Yea.
 
 And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their
 sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he
 shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word.
 
 Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these
 things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the
 Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people--as
 though he had authority to command God.
 
 Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for
 thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God
 because I said he shall not save his people in their sins.
 
 And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their
 sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no
 unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how
 can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven?
 Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.
 
 Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very
 Eternal Father?
 
 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father
 of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is
 the beginning and the end, the first and the last;
 
 And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he
 shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on
 his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and
 salvation cometh to none else.
 
 Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no
 redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death;
 for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and
 stand before God, and be judged according to their works.
 
 Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and
 the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death,
 that all shall be raised from this temporal death.
 
 The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its
 perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper
 frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought
 to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a
 bright recollection of all our guilt.
 
 Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young,
 both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the
 righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their
 heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect
 frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be
 arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father,
 and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged
 according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be
 evil.
 
 Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of
 the mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the
 mortal body. I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to
 an immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death
 unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with
 their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming
 spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.
 
 Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began
 again to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble. And
 thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have
 written.
 
 
 Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced
 Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his lying
 and deceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble
 under a consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began
 to speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to
 explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that
 which Amulek had done.
 
 Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the
 people round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on
 this wise:
 
 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and
 craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast
 lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou
 seest that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;
 
 And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle
 plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive
 this people that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us
 and to cast us out--
 
 Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised
 his power in thee. Now I would that ye should remember that what
 I say unto thee I say unto all.
 
 And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the
 adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might
 bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you
 about with his chains, that he might chain you down to
 everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.
 
 Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble
 more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power
 of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a
 knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the
 thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them
 that they might know of these things according to the spirit of
 prophecy.
 
 And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might
 know more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma:
 What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the
 resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both
 the just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to
 be judged according to their works?
 
 And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying:
 It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless
 they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart
 only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant
 unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence
 which they give unto him.
 
 And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same
 receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not
 harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the
 word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God
 until he know them in full.
 
 And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the
 lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his
 mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led
 by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by
 the chains of hell.
 
 And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being
 raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being
 brought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our
 works.
 
 Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have
 hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not
 been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall
 be condemned.
 
 For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will
 condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will
 also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to
 look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command
 the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his
 presence.
 
 But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him
 in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and
 dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his
 judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he
 is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power
 to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth
 fruit meet for repentance.
 
 And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a
 second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that
 whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also
 die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining
 unto righteousness.
 
 Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of
 fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever;
 and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an
 everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of
 Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.
 
 Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been
 no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to
 God's justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more
 corruption.
 
 Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of
 speaking these words, the people began to be more astonished;
 
 But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them,
 came forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said,
 that man should rise from the dead and be changed from this
 mortal to an immortal state that the soul can never die?
 
 What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed
 cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden,
 lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of
 the tree of life, and live forever? And thus we see that there
 was no possible chance that they should live forever.
 
 Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about
 to explain, now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the
 forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see,
 that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.
 
 And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible
 for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at
 that time, there would have been no death, and the word would
 have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou
 shalt surely die.
 
 And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death
 which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death;
 nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might
 repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time
 to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state
 which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection
 of the dead.
 
 Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was
 laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no
 resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption
 laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of
 which has been spoken.
 
 And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents
 could have gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would
 have been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and
 thus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the
 word of God would have been void, taking none effect.
 
 But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that
 they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even
 that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.
 
 And after God had appointed that these things should come
 unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man
 should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto
 them;
 
 Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused
 men to behold of his glory.
 
 And they began from that time forth to call on his name;
 therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the
 plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation
 of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their
 faith and repentance and their holy works.
 
 Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first
 transgressed the first commandments as to things which were
 temporal, and becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing
 themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act
 according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to
 do good--
 
 Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made
 known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do
 evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an
 everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for
 on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works
 of justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme
 goodness of God.
 
 But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being
 the plan of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent
 and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you,
 through mine Only Begotten Son;
 
 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart,
 he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto
 a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest.
 
 And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity,
 behold, I swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest.
 
 And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will
 harden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord;
 therefore your iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his
 wrath upon you as in the first provocation, yea, according to his
 word in the last provocation as well as the first, to the
 everlasting destruction of your souls; therefore, according to
 his word, unto the last death, as well as the first.
 
 And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they
 are true, let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we
 provoke not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us in
 these his second commandments which he has given unto us; but let
 us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared according to his
 word.
 
 
 And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the
 time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children;
 and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained
 priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his
 Son, to teach these things unto the people.
 
 And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in
 a manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to
 look forward to his Son for redemption.
 
 And this is the manner after which they were ordained--being
 called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to
 the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and
 good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil;
 therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly
 great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy
 calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory
 redemption for such.
 
 And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account
 of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on
 account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their
 minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as
 great privilege as their brethren.
 
 Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing
 with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from
 the foundation of the world for such as would not harden their
 hearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten
 Son, who was prepared--
 
 And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto
 the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his
 commandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter
 into his rest--
 
 This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which
 order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words,
 being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared
 from eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of
 all things--
 
 Now they were ordained after this manner--being called with a
 holy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon
 them the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and
 ordinance, and high priesthood, is without beginning or end--
 
 Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the
 Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of
 days or end of years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth.
 And thus it is. Amen.
 
 Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high
 priesthood, there were many who were ordained and became high
 priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith
 and repentance, and their righteousness before God, they choosing
 to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;
 
 Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were
 sanctified, and their garments were washed white through the
 blood of the Lamb.
 
 Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having
 their garments made white, being pure and spotless before God,
 could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and there
 were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered
 into the rest of the Lord their God.
 
 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble
 yourselves before God, and bring forth fruit meet for repentance,
 that ye may also enter into that rest.
 
 Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of
 Melchizedek, who was also a high priest after this same order
 which I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood
 forever.
 
 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes;
 yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all
 he possessed.
 
 Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that
 thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being
 a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they
 might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that
 they might enter into the rest of the Lord.
 
 Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and
 his people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea,
 they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of
 wickedness;
 
 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received
 the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of
 God, did preach repentance unto his people. And behold, they did
 repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his
 days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the
 king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.
 
 Now, there were many before him, and also there were many
 afterwards, but none were greater; therefore, of him they have
 more particularly made mention.
 
 Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may
 suffice. Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest
 them it shall be to your own destruction.
 
 And now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words
 unto them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a
 mighty voice, saying: Now is the time to repent, for the day of
 salvation draweth nigh;
 
 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth
 declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may
 have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad
 tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are
 scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have
 come unto us.
 
 And they are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may
 understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being
 wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly
 favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all
 parts of our vineyard.
 
 For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this time in
 our land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of
 the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming
 in his glory.
 
 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us
 by the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we
 know not how soon. Would to God that it might be in my day; but
 let it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.
 
 And it shall be made known unto just and holy men, by the
 mouth of angels, at the time of his coming, that the words of our
 fathers may be fulfilled, according to that which they have
 spoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of
 prophecy which was in them.
 
 And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my
 heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would
 hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not
 procrastinate the day of your repentance;
 
 But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call
 on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not
 be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the
 Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of
 love and all long-suffering;
 
 Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive
 eternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that
 ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest.
 
 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not
 bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by
 the chains of hell, that ye may not suffer the second death.
 
 And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not
 written in this book.
 
 
 And it came to pass after he had made an end of speaking unto
 the people many of them did believe on his words, and began to
 repent, and to search the scriptures.
 
 But the more part of them were desirous that they might
 destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because
 of the plainness of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said
 that Amulek had lied unto them, and had reviled against their law
 and also against their lawyers and judges.
 
 And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because
 they had testified so plainly against their wickedness, they
 sought to put them away privily.
 
 But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and
 bound them with strong cords, and took them before the chief
 judge of the land.
 
 And the people went forth and witnessed against
 them--testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their
 lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that
 were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God,
 and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should
 not save them; and many such things did the people testify
 against Alma and Amulek. Now this was done before the chief
 judge of the land.
 
 And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words
 which had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness
 of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his lying
 words; and his soul began to be harrowed up under a consciousness
 of his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the
 pains of hell.
 
 And it came to pass that he began to cry unto the people,
 saying: Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before
 God. And he began to plead for them from that time forth; but
 they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil?
 
 And they spit upon him, and cast him out from among them, and
 also all those who believed in the words which had been spoken by
 Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast
 stones at them.
 
 And they brought their wives and children together, and
 whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of
 God they caused that they should be cast into the fire, and they
 also brought forth their records which contained the holy
 scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be
 burned and destroyed by fire.
 
 And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and
 carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might
 witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.
 
 And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who
 were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto
 Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us
 stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is
 in us, and save them from the flames.
 
 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I
 must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth
 them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may
 do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them,
 according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments
 which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and
 the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them,
 yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.
 
 Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they will burn us
 also.
 
 And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord. But,
 behold, our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.
 
 Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had
 been cast into the fire were consumed, and also the records which
 were cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and
 stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote
 them with his hand upon their cheeks, and said unto them: After
 what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that
 they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone?
 
 Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had
 been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they
 were of thy faith. And the judge smote them again upon their
 cheeks, and asked: What say ye for yourselves?
 
 Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who
 slew Gideon.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him
 nothing; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the
 officers to be cast into prison.
 
 And when they had been cast into prison three days, there
 came many lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who
 were of the profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the prison
 to see them, and they questioned them about many words; but they
 answered them nothing.
 
 And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and
 said: Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not
 that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames? And he
 commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.
 
 And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways,
 but came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again
 on their cheeks. And many came forth also, and smote them,
 saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn
 our law? If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver
 yourselves?
 
 And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their
 teeth upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we
 look when we are damned?
 
 And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they
 say unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days. And
 they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and
 water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them
 their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound with
 strong cords, and confined in prison.
 
 And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many
 days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the
 tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi)
 that the chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of their
 teachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison where Alma and
 Amulek were bound with cords.
 
 And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again,
 and said unto them: If ye have the power of God deliver
 yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the
 Lord will destroy this people according to your words.
 
 And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them,
 saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had
 spoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and
 they rose and stood upon their feet.
 
 And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great
 afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength according to our
 faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke
 the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw
 this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come
 upon them.
 
 And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they
 fell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the
 prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison
 were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief
 judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon
 Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.
 
 And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they
 were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power,
 according to their faith which was in Christ. And they
 straightway came forth out of the prison; and they were loosed
 from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and
 every soul within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and
 Amulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city.
 
 Now the people having heard a great noise came running
 together by multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw
 Alma and Amulek coming forth out of the prison, and the walls
 thereof had fallen to the earth, they were struck with great
 fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even as a
 goat fleeth with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee
 from the presence of Alma and Amulek.
 
 
 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to
 depart out of that city; and they departed, and came out even
 into the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found all the
 people who had departed out of the land of Ammonihah, who had
 been cast out and stoned, because they believed in the words of
 Alma.
 
 And they related unto them all that had happened unto their
 wives and children, and also concerning themselves, and of their
 power of deliverance.
 
 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever,
 which was caused by the great tribulations of his mind on account
 of his wickedness, for he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no
 more; and he supposed that they had been slain because of his
 iniquity. And this great sin, and his many other sins, did
 harrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having
 no deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning
 heat.
 
 Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of
 Sidom, his heart began to take courage; and he sent a message
 immediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him.
 
 And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the
 message which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the
 house unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed, sick, being
 very low with a burning fever; and his mind also was exceedingly
 sore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched
 forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the
 hand: Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?
 
 And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the words that
 thou hast taught.
 
 And Alma said: If thou believest in the redemption of Christ
 thou canst be healed.
 
 And he said: Yea, I believe according to thy words.
 
 And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God,
 have mercy on this man, and heal him according to his faith which
 is in Christ.
 
 And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom leaped upon his
 feet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great
 astonishment of all the people; and the knowledge of this went
 forth throughout all the land of Sidom.
 
 And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from
 that time forth to preach unto the people.
 
 And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and
 consecrated priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the
 Lord whosoever were desirous to be baptized.
 
 And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock
 in from all the region round about Sidom, and were baptized.
 
 But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they
 yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they
 repented not of their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and
 Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of Nehor,
 and did not believe in the repentance of their sins.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having
 forsaken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which
 were in the land of Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being
 rejected by those who were once his friends and also by his
 father and his kindred;
 
 Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom,
 seeing a great check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as
 to the pride of their hearts, and began to humble themselves
 before God, and began to assemble themselves together at their
 sanctuaries to worship God before the altar, watching and praying
 continually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and from
 death, and from destruction--
 
 Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore
 he took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took
 him to his own house, and did administer unto him in his
 tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord.
 
 And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over
 the people of Nephi.
 
 
 And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the
 judges over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second
 month, there having been much peace in the land of Zarahemla,
 there having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of
 years, even until the fifth day of the second month in the
 eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the land.
 
 For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the
 wilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city
 of Ammonihah, and began to slay the people and destroy the city.
 
 And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a
 sufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had destroyed
 the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, and also some
 around the borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the
 wilderness.
 
 Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain
 those who had been carried away captive into the wilderness.
 
 Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the
 armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two
 sons, Lehi and Aha)--now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that
 Alma was high priest over the church, and having heard that he
 had the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went unto him and
 desired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go
 into the wilderness in search of their brethren, who had been
 taken captive by the Lamanites.
 
 And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning
 the matter. And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the
 Lamanites will cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness,
 away up beyond the borders of the land of Manti. And behold
 there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon, and
 there the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren who have been
 taken captive by the Lamanites.
 
 And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the
 river Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond the
 borders of Manti into the south wilderness, which was on the east
 side of the river Sidon.
 
 And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the
 Lamanites were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they
 took their brethren who had been taken captive by the Lamanites,
 and there was not one soul of them had been lost that were taken
 captive. And they were brought by their brethren to possess
 their own lands.
 
 And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites
 having been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah
 were destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites was
 destroyed, and also their great city, which they said God could
 not destroy, because of its greatness.
 
 But behold, in one day it was left desolate; and the
 carcasses were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness.
 
 Nevertheless, after many days their dead bodies were heaped
 up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a
 shallow covering. And now so great was the scent thereof that
 the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for
 many years. And it was called Desolation of Nehors; for they
 were of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands
 remained desolate.
 
 And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the
 Nephites until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges
 over the people of Nephi. And thus for three years did the
 people of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.
 
 And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the
 people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in
 their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews.
 
 And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did
 impart the word of God, without any respect of persons,
 continually.
 
 And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who
 had been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all
 the land. And the establishment of the church became general
 throughout the land, in all the region round about, among all the
 people of the Nephites.
 
 And there was no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out
 his Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of
 the children of men, or to prepare their hearts to receive the
 word which should be taught among them at the time of his
 coming--
 
 That they might not be hardened against the word, that they
 might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they
 might receive the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into
 the true vine, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord
 their God.
 
 Now those priests who did go forth among the people did
 preach against all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and
 strifes, and malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing,
 plundering, murdering, committing adultery, and all manner of
 lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be--
 
 Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding
 forth the coming of the Son of God, his sufferings and death, and
 also the resurrection of the dead.
 
 And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where
 the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would
 appear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did
 hear with great joy and gladness.
 
 And now after the church had been established throughout all
 the land--having got the victory over the devil, and the word of
 God being preached in its purity in all the land, and the Lord
 pouring out his blessings upon the people--thus ended the
 fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
 Nephi.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the
 land of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to
 his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying
 towards the land of Zarahemla.
 
 Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel
 first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly
 to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were
 still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in
 the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound
 understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently,
 that they might know the word of God.
 
 But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer,
 and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the
 spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with
 power and authority of God.
 
 And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of
 fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much success in
 bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of
 their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on
 his name and confess their sins before him.
 
 Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their
 journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much,
 both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and
 also much labor in the spirit.
 
 Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their
 father, Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having refused
 the kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them,
 and also this was the minds of the people;
 
 Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and
 took their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their
 arrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might
 provide food for themselves while in the wilderness.
 
 And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers
 which they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach
 the word of God unto the Lamanites.
 
 And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the
 wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord
 would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them,
 and abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the
 hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the
 Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the
 baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not
 correct.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his
 Spirit, and said unto them: Be comforted. And they were
 comforted.
 
 And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the
 Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be
 patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth
 good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of
 thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.
 
 And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah,
 and also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto
 the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.
 
 And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of
 the land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and
 departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should
 meet again at the close of their harvest; for they supposed that
 great was the work which they had undertaken.
 
 And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach
 the word of God to a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people;
 a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and
 plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon
 gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain
 these things by murdering and plundering, that they might not
 labor for them with their own hands.
 
 Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did
 worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because
 of the traditions of their fathers; notwithstanding the promises
 of the Lord were extended unto them on the conditions of
 repentance.
 
 Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah
 had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto
 repentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the
 plan of redemption.
 
 Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and
 went forth among them, every man alone, according to the word and
 power of God which was given unto him.
 
 Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did
 administer unto them, and he departed from them, after having
 blessed them according to their several stations, having imparted
 the word of God unto them, or administered unto them before his
 departure; and thus they took their several journeys throughout
 the land.
 
 And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called
 after the sons of Ishmael, who also became Lamanites.
 
 And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took
 him and bound him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites
 who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and
 thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to
 retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast
 them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.
 
 And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the
 land of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant
 of Ishmael.
 
 And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell
 in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people.
 
 And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this
 people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.
 
 And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with
 Ammon, and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would
 that Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife.
 
 But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant.
 Therefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to
 pass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of
 Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites.
 
 And after he had been in the service of the king three days,
 as he was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their
 flocks to the place of water, which was called the water of
 Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that they
 may have water--
 
 Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving
 forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain
 number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water,
 stood and scattered the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the
 king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.
 
 Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the
 king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks
 were scattered by the wickedness of these men. And they began to
 weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered
 already.
 
 Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when
 Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for,
 said he, I will show forth my power unto these my
 fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these
 flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my
 fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words.
 
 And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the
 afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words,
 saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of
 the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back
 unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks
 unto the king and he will not slay us.
 
 And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks,
 and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much
 swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather
 them together again to the place of water.
 
 And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon
 said unto his brethren: Encircle the flocks round about that they
 flee not; and I go and contend with these men who do scatter our
 flocks.
 
 Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went
 forth and stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of
 Sebus; and they were in number not a few.
 
 Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one
 of their men could slay him according to their pleasure, for they
 knew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver
 his sons out of their hands; neither did they know anything
 concerning the Lord; therefore they delighted in the destruction
 of their brethren; and for this cause they stood to scatter the
 flocks of the king.
 
 But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with
 his sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst
 them; and thus he slew a certain number of them insomuch that
 they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were
 angry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were
 determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they could
 not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay
 him.
 
 But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he
 smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their
 blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch
 that they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him;
 yea, and they were not few in number; and he caused them to flee
 by the strength of his arm.
 
 Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none
 save it were their leader with his sword; and he smote off as
 many of their arms as were lifted against him, and they were not
 a few.
 
 And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they
 watered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the
 king, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had
 been smitten off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to
 slay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony
 of the things which they had done.
 
 
 And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants
 should stand forth and testify to all the things which they had
 seen concerning the matter.
 
 And when they had all testified to the things which they had
 seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in
 preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending
 against those who sought to slay him, he was astonished
 exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man. Behold,
 is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments
 upon this people, because of their murders?
 
 And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great
 Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he
 cannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they
 scatter the king's flocks when he is with us, because of his
 expertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a
 friend to the king. And now, O king, we do not believe that a
 man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.
 
 And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them:
 Now I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at
 this time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I
 did your brethren. Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our
 fathers have spoken.
 
 Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received
 from his father, that there was a Great Spirit. Notwithstanding
 they believed in a Great Spirit they supposed that whatsoever
 they did was right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear
 exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his
 servants;
 
 For he had slain many of them because their brethren had
 scattered their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because
 they had had their flocks scattered they were slain.
 
 Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the
 waters of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby
 they might drive away many that were scattered unto their own
 land, it being a practice of plunder among them.
 
 And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants,
 saying: Where is this man that has such great power?
 
 And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now
 the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the
 watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and
 chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there
 had been a great feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the
 father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.
 
 Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his
 horses and his chariots he was more astonished, because of the
 faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any
 servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this
 man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute
 them.
 
 Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would
 desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.
 
 And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses
 and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto
 the king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was
 changed; therefore he was about to return out of his presence.
 
 And one of the king's servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which
 is, being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their
 kings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the
 king desireth thee to stay.
 
 Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto
 him: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king? And the
 king answered him not for the space of an hour, according to
 their time, for he knew not what he should say unto him.
 
 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What
 desirest thou of me? But the king answered him not.
 
 And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the Spirit
 of God, therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king. And he
 said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy
 servants and thy flocks, and slew seven of their brethren with
 the sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others,
 in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it
 this that causeth thy marvelings?
 
 I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great?
 
 Behold, I am a man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever
 thou desirest which is right, that will I do.
 
 Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again,
 for he beheld that Ammon could discern his thoughts; but
 notwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said
 unto him: Who art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows
 all things?
 
 Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.
 
 And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart?
 
 Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things;
 and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of
 my brethren that scattered my flocks--
 
 And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things,
 whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were
 needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou
 art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou
 desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.
 
 Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt
 thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do
 these things? And this is the thing that I desire of thee.
 
 And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all
 thy words. And thus he was caught with guile.
 
 And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said
 unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?
 
 And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that
 meaneth.
 
 And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great
 Spirit?
 
 And he said, Yea.
 
 And Ammon said: This is God. And Ammon said unto him again:
 Believest thou that this Great Spirit, who is God, created all
 things which are in heaven and in the earth?
 
 And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which
 are in the earth; but I do not know the heavens.
 
 And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God
 dwells and all his holy angels.
 
 And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth?
 
 And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the
 children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the
 heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning.
 
 And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou
 hast spoken. Art thou sent from God?
 
 Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was
 created after the image of God, and I am called by his Holy
 Spirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be
 brought to a knowledge of that which is just and true;
 
 And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me
 knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which
 are in God.
 
 Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation
 of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the
 things concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before
 him the records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had
 been spoken by the prophets, even down to the time that their
 father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.
 
 And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the king and
 to his servants) all the journeyings of their fathers in the
 wilderness, and all their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and
 their travail, and so forth.
 
 And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the rebellions of
 Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all their
 rebellions did he relate unto them; and he expounded unto them
 all the records and scriptures from the time that Lehi left
 Jerusalem down to the present time.
 
 But this is not all; for he expounded unto them the plan of
 redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world;
 and he also made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ,
 and all the works of the Lord did he make known unto them.
 
 And it came to pass that after he had said all these things,
 and expounded them to the king, that the king believed all his
 words.
 
 And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have
 mercy; according to thy abundant mercy which thou hast had upon
 the people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people.
 
 And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if
 he were dead.
 
 And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried
 him in unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if
 he were dead for the space of two days and two nights; and his
 wife, and his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after the
 manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his loss.
 
 
 And it came to pass that after two days and two nights they
 were about to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre, which they
 had made for the purpose of burying their dead.
 
 Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she
 sent and desired that he should come in unto her.
 
 And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and
 went in unto the queen, and desired to know what she would that
 he should do.
 
 And she said unto him: The servants of my husband have made it
 known unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that
 thou hast power to do many mighty works in his name;
 
 Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in
 and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the
 space of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not
 dead, but others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and
 that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself,
 to me he doth not stink.
 
 Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni
 was under the power of God; he knew that the dark veil of
 unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which
 did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God,
 which was a marvelous light of his goodness--yea, this light had
 infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having been
 dispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in
 his soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame,
 and he was carried away in God--
 
 Therefore, what the queen desired of him was his only desire.
 Therefore, he went in to see the king according as the queen had
 desired him; and he saw the king, and he knew that he was not
 dead.
 
 And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but he sleepeth in
 God, and on the morrow he shall rise again; therefore bury him
 not.
 
 And Ammon said unto her: Believest thou this? And she said
 unto him: I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of
 our servants; nevertheless I believe that it shall be according
 as thou hast said.
 
 And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy
 exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such
 great faith among all the people of the Nephites.
 
 And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her
 husband, from that time even until that time on the morrow which
 Ammon had appointed that he should rise.
 
 And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words of
 Ammon; and as he arose, he stretched forth his hand unto the
 woman, and said: Blessed be the name of God, and blessed art
 thou.
 
 For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer;
 and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall
 redeem all mankind who believe on his name. Now, when he had
 said these words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk
 again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered
 by the Spirit.
 
 Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out according
 to his prayers upon the Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the
 cause of so much mourning among the Nephites, or among all the
 people of God because of their iniquities and their traditions,
 he fell upon his knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer
 and thanksgiving to God for what he had done for his brethren;
 and he was also overpowered with joy; and thus they all three had
 sunk to the earth.
 
 Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had
 fallen, they also began to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord
 had come upon them also, for it was they who had stood before the
 king and testified unto him concerning the great power of Ammon.
 
 And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the
 Lord, in their might, even until they had all fallen to the
 earth, save it were one of the Lamanitish women, whose name was
 Abish, she having been converted unto the Lord for many years, on
 account of a remarkable vision of her father--
 
 Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having
 made it known, therefore, when she saw that all the servants of
 Lamoni had fallen to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen,
 and the king, and Ammon lay prostrate upon the earth, she knew
 that it was the power of God; and supposing that this
 opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened
 among them, that by beholding this scene it would cause them to
 believe in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house
 to house, making it known unto the people.
 
 And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house
 of the king. And there came a multitude, and to their
 astonishment they beheld the king, and the queen, and their
 servants prostrate upon the earth, and they all lay there as
 though they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold, he
 was a Nephite.
 
 And now the people began to murmur among themselves; some
 saying that it was a great evil that had come upon them, or upon
 the king and his house, because he had suffered that the Nephite
 should remain in the land.
 
 But others rebuked them, saying: The king hath brought this
 evil upon his house, because he slew his servants who had had
 their flocks scattered at the waters of Sebus.
 
 And they were also rebuked by those men who had stood at the
 waters of Sebus and scattered the flocks which belonged to the
 king, for they were angry with Ammon because of the number which
 he had slain of their brethren at the waters of Sebus, while
 defending the flocks of the king.
 
 Now, one of them, whose brother had been slain with the sword
 of Ammon, being exceedingly angry with Ammon, drew his sword and
 went forth that he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and
 as he lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell dead.
 
 Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for the Lord had
 said unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be
 unto him according to thy faith--therefore, Mosiah trusted him
 unto the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the
 man had fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, fear
 came upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to
 touch him or any of those who had fallen; and they began to
 marvel again among themselves what could be the cause of this
 great power, or what all these things could mean.
 
 And it came to pass that there were many among them who said
 that Ammon was the Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by
 the Great Spirit;
 
 But others rebuked them all, saying that he was a monster,
 who had been sent from the Nephites to torment them.
 
 And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great
 Spirit to afflict them because of their iniquities; and that it
 was the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who
 had ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said that it
 was this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of their
 brethren, the Lamanites.
 
 And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among
 them. And while they were thus contending, the woman servant who
 had caused the multitude to be gathered together came, and when
 she saw the contention which was among the multitude she was
 exceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears.
 
 And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the
 hand, that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as
 soon as she touched her hand she arose and stood upon her feet,
 and cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has
 saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have mercy on this
 people!
 
 And when she had said this, she clasped her hands, being
 filled with joy, speaking many words which were not understood;
 and when she had done this, she took the king, Lamoni, by the
 hand, and behold he arose and stood upon his feet.
 
 And he, immediately, seeing the contention among his people,
 went forth and began to rebuke them, and to teach them the words
 which he had heard from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as heard
 his words believed, and were converted unto the Lord.
 
 But there were many among them who would not hear his words;
 therefore they went their way.
 
 And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also
 administered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni;
 and they did all declare unto the people the selfsame thing--that
 their hearts had been changed; that they had no more desire to do
 evil.
 
 And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had
 seen angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told
 them things of God, and of his righteousness.
 
 And it came to pass that there were many that did believe in
 their words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they
 became a righteous people, and they did establish a church among
 them.
 
 And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the
 Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his Spirit upon
 them; and we see that his arm is extended to all people who will
 repent and believe on his name.
 
 
 And it came to pass that when they had established a church in
 that land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him
 to the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father.
 
 And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon saying: Thou shalt not
 go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy
 life; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy
 brother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.
 
 Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he said
 unto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and brethren are in prison at
 Middoni, and I go that I may deliver them.
 
 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the
 Lord thou canst do all things. But behold, I will go with thee
 to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni,
 whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to
 the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and
 he will cast thy brethren out of prison. Now Lamoni said unto
 him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?
 
 And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God;
 and he said unto me--Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in
 prison in the land of Middoni.
 
 Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants
 should make ready his horses and his chariots.
 
 And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the
 land of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he
 will cast thy brethren out of prison.
 
 And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni were journeying
 thither, they met the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the
 land.
 
 And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye not
 come to the feast on that great day when I made a feast unto my
 sons, and unto my people?
 
 And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite,
 who is one of the children of a liar?
 
 And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he
 was going, for he feared to offend him.
 
 And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own
 kingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he
 had prepared.
 
 And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things,
 behold, to his astonishment, his father was angry with him, and
 said: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, who are
 sons of a liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his
 children are also come amongst us that they may, by their cunning
 and their lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our
 property.
 
 Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay
 Ammon with the sword. And he also commanded him that he should
 not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him
 to the land of Ishmael.
 
 But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will
 I return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni
 that I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they
 are just men and holy prophets of the true God.
 
 Now when his father had heard these words, he was angry with
 him, and he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.
 
 But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt
 not slay thy son; nevertheless, it were better that he should
 fall than thee, for behold, he has repented of his sins; but if
 thou shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul could
 not be saved.
 
 And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if
 thou shouldst slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood
 would cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to
 come upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul.
 
 Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered
 him, saying: I know that if I should slay my son, that I should
 shed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy
 him.
 
 And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon. But Ammon
 withstood his blows, and also smote his arm that he could not use
 it.
 
 Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to
 plead with Ammon that he would spare his life.
 
 But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will
 smite thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be
 cast out of prison.
 
 Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou
 wilt spare me I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask,
 even to half of the kingdom.
 
 Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king
 according to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant
 that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni
 may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him,
 but grant that he may do according to his own desires in
 whatsoever thing he thinketh, then will I spare thee; otherwise I
 will smite thee to the earth.
 
 Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to
 rejoice because of his life.
 
 And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to destroy him, and
 when he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was
 astonished exceedingly, and said: Because this is all that thou
 hast desired, that I would release thy brethren, and suffer that
 my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant
 unto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and
 forever; and I will govern him no more--
 
 And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast
 out of prison, and thou and thy brethren may come unto me, in my
 kingdom; for I shall greatly desire to see thee. For the king
 was greatly astonished at the words which he had spoken, and also
 at the words which had been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore
 he was desirous to learn them.
 
 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their
 journey towards the land of Middoni. And Lamoni found favor in
 the eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon
 were brought forth out of prison.
 
 And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful,
 for behold they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly
 because of being bound with strong cords. And they also had
 suffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions;
 nevertheless they were patient in all their sufferings.
 
 And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the
 hands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; therefore
 they would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them
 out, and had smitten them, and had driven them from house to
 house, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in
 the land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into
 prison, and bound with strong cords, and kept in prison for many
 days, and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon.
 
 
 Now when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the
 borders of the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his
 journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites,
 Jerusalem, calling it after the land of their fathers' nativity;
 and it was away joining the borders of Mormon.
 
 Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of Amulon
 had built a great city, which was called Jerusalem.
 
 Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened,
 but the Amalekites and the Amulonites were still harder;
 therefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden
 their hearts, that they should wax strong in wickedness and their
 abominations.
 
 And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem,
 and first began to preach to the Amalekites. And he began to
 preach to them in their synagogues, for they had built synagogues
 after the order of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the
 Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors
 
 Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to
 preach unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold
 there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying:
 What is that thou hast testified? Hast thou seen an angel? Why
 do not angels appear unto us? Behold are not this people as good
 as thy people?
 
 Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish. How
 knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts? How knowest
 thou that we have cause to repent? How knowest thou that we are
 not a righteous people? Behold, we have built sanctuaries, and
 we do assemble ourselves together to worship God. We do believe
 that God will save all men.
 
 Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God
 shall come to redeem mankind from their sins?
 
 And the man said unto him: We do not believe that thou knowest
 any such thing. We do not believe in these foolish traditions.
 We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do
 we believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know
 concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.
 
 Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them concerning
 the coming of Christ, and also concerning the resurrection of the
 dead, and that there could be no redemption for mankind save it
 were through the death and sufferings of Christ, and the
 atonement of his blood.
 
 And it came to pass as he began to expound these things unto
 them they were angry with him, and began to mock him; and they
 would not hear the words which he spake.
 
 Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he
 departed out of their synagogue, and came over to a village which
 was called Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word
 unto them; and also Ammah and his brethren. And they contended
 with many about the word.
 
 And it came to pass that they saw that the people would
 harden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into
 the land of Middoni. And they did preach the word unto many, and
 few believed on the words which they taught.
 
 Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were
 taken and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of
 the land of Middoni unto the regions round about.
 
 And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and
 they were delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon, and they
 were fed and clothed.
 
 And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they
 were delivered for the first time out of prison; and thus they
 had suffered.
 
 And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the Spirit
 of the Lord, preaching the word of God in every synagogue of the
 Amalekites, or in every assembly of the Lamanites where they
 could be admitted.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord began to bless them,
 insomuch that they brought many to the knowledge of the truth;
 yea, they did convince many of their sins, and of the traditions
 of their fathers, which were not correct.
 
 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned from the
 land of Middoni to the land of Ishmael, which was the land of
 their inheritance.
 
 And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should serve him,
 or be his servant.
 
 But he caused that there should be synagogues built in the
 land of Ishmael; and he caused that his people, or the people who
 were under his reign, should assemble themselves together.
 
 And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many
 things. And he did also declare unto them that they were a
 people who were under him, and that they were a free people, that
 they were free from the oppressions of the king, his father; for
 that his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the
 people who were in the land of Ishmael, and in all the land round
 about.
 
 And he also declared unto them that they might have the
 liberty of worshiping the Lord their God according to their
 desires, in whatsoever place they were in, if it were in the land
 which was under the reign of king Lamoni.
 
 And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; and it
 came to pass that he did teach them all things concerning things
 pertaining to righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with
 all diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were
 zealous for keeping the commandments of God.
 
 
 Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni
 continually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his
 brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was
 led by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the
 king which was over all the land save it were the land of
 Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.
 
 And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king's
 palace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and
 said unto him: Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom
 thou hast delivered out of prison.
 
 And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy
 servants. And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant
 unto you your lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my
 servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for
 I have been somewhat troubled in mind because of the generosity
 and the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire
 to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with
 thee.
 
 And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord
 has called him another way; he has gone to the land of Ishmael,
 to teach the people of Lamoni.
 
 Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said
 concerning the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, this is the thing
 which doth trouble me.
 
 And also, what is this that Ammon said--If ye will repent ye
 shall be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off
 at the last day?
 
 And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that
 there is a God? And the king said: I know that the Amalekites
 say that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they
 should build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves
 together to worship him. And if now thou sayest there is a God,
 behold I will believe.
 
 And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and
 he said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a
 God.
 
 And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that brought our
 fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?
 
 And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he
 created all things both in heaven and in earth. Believest thou
 this?
 
 And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all
 things, and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these
 things, and I will believe thy words.
 
 And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would
 believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading
 the scriptures unto the king--how God created man after his own
 image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of
 transgression, man had fallen.
 
 And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the
 creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their
 carnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared
 from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all
 whosoever would believe on his name.
 
 And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of
 himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their
 sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he
 breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no
 victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in
 the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto
 the king.
 
 And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these
 things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have
 this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I
 do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted
 out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled
 with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold,
 said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake
 my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.
 
 But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou
 wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy
 sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in
 faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive
 the hope which thou desirest.
 
 And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the
 king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he
 did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:
 
 O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there
 is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto
 me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may
 be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day. And now
 when the king had said these words, he was struck as if he were
 dead.
 
 And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen
 all that had happened unto the king. And she came in unto the
 king; and when she saw him lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron
 and his brethren standing as though they had been the cause of
 his fall, she was angry with them, and commanded that her
 servants, or the servants of the king, should take them and slay
 them.
 
 Now the servants had seen the cause of the king's fall,
 therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his
 brethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest
 thou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is
 mightier than us all? Therefore we shall fall before them.
 
 Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also
 began to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon
 her. And she commanded her servants that they should go and call
 the people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren.
 
 Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, he, also
 knowing the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest
 that a multitude should assemble themselves together, and there
 should be a great contention and a disturbance among them;
 therefore he put forth his hand and raised the king from the
 earth, and said unto him: Stand. And he stood upon his feet,
 receiving his strength.
 
 Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of
 the servants. And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and
 began to fear. And the king stood forth, and began to minister
 unto them. And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his
 whole household were converted unto the Lord.
 
 Now there was a multitude gathered together because of the
 commandment of the queen, and there began to be great murmurings
 among them because of Aaron and his brethren.
 
 But the king stood forth among them and administered unto
 them. And they were pacified towards Aaron and those who were
 with him.
 
 And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people
 were pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand
 forth in the midst of the multitude, and that they should preach
 the word unto them.
 
 And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation
 throughout all the land, amongst all his people who were in all
 his land, who were in all the regions round about, which was
 bordering even to the sea, on the east and on the west, and which
 was divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of
 wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and
 round about on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of
 the wilderness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla,
 through the borders of Manti, by the head of the river Sidon,
 running from the east towards the west--and thus were the
 Lamanites and the Nephites divided.
 
 Now, the more idle part of the Lamanites lived in the
 wilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the
 wilderness on the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on
 the west of the land of Zarahemla, in the borders by the
 seashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the place of
 their fathers' first inheritance, and thus bordering along by the
 seashore.
 
 And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the
 seashore, whither the Nephites had driven them. And thus the
 Nephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless
 the Nephites had taken possession of all the northern parts of
 the land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the river
 Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness
 side; on the north, even until they came to the land which they
 called Bountiful.
 
 And it bordered upon the land which they called Desolation,
 it being so far northward that it came into the land which had
 been peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken,
 which was discovered by the people of Zarahemla, it being the
 place of their first landing.
 
 And they came from there up into the south wilderness. Thus
 the land on the northward was called Desolation, and the land on
 the southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which
 is filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part
 of which had come from the land northward for food.
 
 And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half's
 journey for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land
 Desolation, from the east to the west sea; and thus the land of
 Nephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly surrounded by water,
 there being a small neck of land between the land northward and
 the land southward.
 
 And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land
 Bountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the
 Nephites in their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had
 hemmed in the Lamanites on the south, that thereby they should
 have no more possession on the north, that they might not overrun
 the land northward.
 
 Therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only
 in the land of Nephi, and the wilderness round about. Now this
 was wisdom in the Nephites--as the Lamanites were an enemy to
 them, they would not suffer their afflictions on every hand, and
 also that they might have a country whither they might flee,
 according to their desires.
 
 And now I, after having said this, return again to the
 account of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and their brethren.
 
 
 Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites
 sent a proclamation among all his people, that they should not
 lay their hands on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor
 either of their brethren who should go forth preaching the word
 of God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any part of their
 land.
 
 Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay
 their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison;
 neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them
 out of their synagogues, nor scourge them; neither should they
 cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to
 their houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries.
 
 And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to
 their desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and
 all his household; therefore he sent his proclamation throughout
 the land unto his people, that the word of God might have no
 obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land,
 that his people might be convinced concerning the wicked
 traditions of their fathers, and that they might be convinced
 that they were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder,
 nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to
 commit any manner of wickedness.
 
 And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this
 proclamation, that Aaron and his brethren went forth from city to
 city, and from one house of worship to another, establishing
 churches, and consecrating priests and teachers throughout the
 land among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God
 among them; and thus they began to have great success.
 
 And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea,
 thousands were brought to believe in the traditions of the
 Nephites; and they were taught the records and prophecies which
 were handed down even to the present time.
 
 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed,
 or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through
 the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit
 of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working
 miracles in them--yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as
 many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were
 converted unto the Lord, never did fall away.
 
 For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the
 weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God
 any more, neither against any of their brethren.
 
 Now, these are they who were converted unto the Lord:
 
 The people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Ishmael;
 
 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land
 of Middoni;
 
 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the city
 of Nephi;
 
 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land
 of Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the city
 of Lemuel, and in the city of Shimnilom.
 
 And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which
 were converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down
 the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war;
 and they were all Lamanites.
 
 And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither
 were any of the Amulonites; but they did harden their hearts, and
 also the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land
 wheresoever they dwelt, yea, and all their villages and all their
 cities.
 
 Therefore, we have named all the cities of the Lamanites in
 which they did repent and come to the knowledge of the truth, and
 were converted.
 
 And now it came to pass that the king and those who were
 converted were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby
 they might be distinguished from their brethren; therefore the
 king consulted with Aaron and many of their priests, concerning
 the name that they should take upon them, that they might be
 distinguished.
 
 And it came to pass that they called their names
 Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were called by this name and were no
 more called Lamanites.
 
 And they began to be a very industrious people; yea, and they
 were friendly with the Nephites; therefore, they did open a
 correspondence with them, and the curse of God did no more follow
 them.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the Amalekites and the Amulonites and
 the Lamanites who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the
 land of Helam, and who were in the land of Jerusalem, and in
 fine, in all the land round about, who had not been converted and
 had not taken upon them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred
 up by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to anger against their
 brethren.
 
 And their hatred became exceedingly sore against them, even
 insomuch that they began to rebel against their king, insomuch
 that they would not that he should be their king; therefore, they
 took up arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.
 
 Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called
 his name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.
 
 And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites
 began to make preparations for war against the people of God.
 
 Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up
 with him saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their
 brethren, they came forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon
 met all his brethren; and from thence they came to the land of
 Ishmael that they might hold a council with Lamoni and also with
 his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend
 themselves against the Lamanites.
 
 Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been
 converted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their
 brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war;
 yea, and also their king commanded them that they should not.
 
 Now, these are the words which he said unto the people
 concerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that
 our great God has in goodness sent these our brethren, the
 Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to convince us of the
 traditions of our wicked fathers.
 
 And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a
 portion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a
 correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites.
 
 And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this
 correspondence we have been convinced of our sins, and of the
 many murders which we have committed.
 
 And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath
 granted unto us that we might repent of these things, and also
 that he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which
 we have committed, and taken away the guilt from our hearts,
 through the merits of his Son.
 
 And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we
 could do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of
 all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to
 get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we
 could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take
 away our stain--
 
 Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our
 stains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our
 swords no more with the blood of our brethren.
 
 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that
 they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps,
 if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed
 bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall
 be shed for the atonement of our sins.
 
 And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things
 known unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made
 these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our
 souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy
 he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might
 be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.
 
 Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has
 been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us,
 and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they
 may be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or
 at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be
 judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our
 brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean
 thereby.
 
 And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us,
 behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them
 deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony
 that we have never used them, at the last day; and if our
 brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be
 saved.
 
 And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of
 these sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they
 took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the
 shedding of man's blood, and they did bury them up deep in the
 earth.
 And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God,
 and also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the
 shedding of man's blood; and this they did, vouching and
 covenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their
 brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take
 away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than
 spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with
 their hands.
 
 And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to
 believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer
 even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they
 buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war,
 for peace.
 
 And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made
 preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the
 purpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his
 stead, and also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out
 of the land.
 
 Now when the people saw that they were coming against them
 they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them
 to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus
 they were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon
 them, and began to slay them with the sword.
 
 And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a
 thousand and five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for
 they have gone to dwell with their God.
 
 Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee
 from the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand
 or to the left, but that they would lie down and perish, and
 praised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword--
 
 Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying
 them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for
 those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they
 repented of the things which they had done.
 
 And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of
 war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for
 the murders which they had committed; and they came down even as
 their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were
 lifted to slay them.
 
 And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that
 day by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had
 been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to
 doubt but what they were saved.
 
 And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there
 were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth;
 thus we see that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation
 of his people.
 
 Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so
 many of their brethren were Amalekites and Amulonites, the
 greatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors.
 
 Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there
 were none who were Amalekites or Amulonites, or who were of the
 order of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and
 Lemuel.
 
 And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have
 been once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great
 knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have
 fallen away into sin and transgression, they become more
 hardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though they had
 never known these things.
 
 
 And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more
 angry because they had slain their brethren; therefore they swore
 vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay
 the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time.
 
 But they took their armies and went over into the borders of
 the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people who were in the
 land of Ammonihah, and destroyed them.
 
 And after that, they had many battles with the Nephites, in
 the which they were driven and slain.
 
 And among the Lamanites who were slain were almost all the
 seed of Amulon and his brethren, who were the priests of Noah,
 and they were slain by the hands of the Nephites;
 
 And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and
 having usurped the power and authority over the Lamanites, caused
 that many of the Lamanites should perish by fire because of their
 belief--
 
 For many of them, after having suffered much loss and so many
 afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the words
 which Aaron and his brethren had preached to them in their land;
 therefore they began to disbelieve the traditions of their
 fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great power
 unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in
 the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of
 the children of Amulon caused that they should be put to death,
 yea, all those that believed in these things.
 
 Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should
 be stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the
 wilderness; and the Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon
 and his brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into the
 east wilderness.
 
 And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites. Thus
 the words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said
 concerning the seed of the priests who caused that he should
 suffer death by fire.
 
 For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me shall be a
 type of things to come.
 
 And now Abinadi was the first that suffered death by fire
 because of his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that
 many should suffer death by fire, according as he had suffered.
 
 And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should
 cause many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and
 that they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep
 having no shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts; and now
 behold, these words were verified, for they were driven by the
 Lamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten.
 
 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they
 could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own
 land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael
 and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of
 God, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.
 
 And they did also bury their weapons of war, according as
 their brethren had, and they began to be a righteous people; and
 they did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep
 his commandments and his statutes.
 
 Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient
 that they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all
 fulfilled. But notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look
 forward to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of
 Moses was a type of his coming, and believing that they must keep
 those outward performances until the time that he should be
 revealed unto them.
 
 Now they did not suppose that salvation came by the law of
 Moses; but the law of Moses did serve to strengthen their faith
 in Christ; and thus they did retain a hope through faith, unto
 eternal salvation, relying upon the spirit of prophecy, which
 spake of those things to come.
 
 And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and
 their brethren did rejoice exceedingly, for the success which
 they had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had
 granted unto them according to their prayers, and that he had
 also verified his word unto them in every particular.
 
 
 And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which
 say thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how
 great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when
 we started from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted
 unto us such great blessings?
 
 And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us?
 Can ye tell?
 
 Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites,
 were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how
 many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God!
 And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that
 we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about
 this great work.
 
 Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and have been brought
 into the fold of God.
 
 Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did
 thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the
 day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves!
 And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not
 wasted.
 
 Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last
 day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds;
 but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in
 their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea,
 neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the
 enemy listeth to carry them.
 
 But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest,
 and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day.
 
 Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise,
 yea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work
 righteousness forever.
 
 For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these
 our dearly beloved brethren, who have so dearly beloved us, would
 still have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they
 would also have been strangers to God.
 
 And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his
 brother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy
 doth carry thee away unto boasting.
 
 But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength,
 nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart
 is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.
 
 Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak;
 therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God,
 for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty
 miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise
 his name forever.
 
 Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from
 the pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love,
 and this because of the power of his word which is in us,
 therefore have we not great reason to rejoice?
 
 Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most
 High God, and has loosed our brethren from the chains of hell.
 
 Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and
 destruction; but behold, he has brought them into his everlasting
 light, yea, into everlasting salvation; and they are encircled
 about with the matchless bounty of his love; yea, and we have
 been instruments in his hands of doing this great and marvelous
 work.
 
 Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea,
 we will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God
 forever. Behold, who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who
 can say too much of his great power, and of his mercy, and of his
 long-suffering towards the children of men? Behold, I say unto
 you, I cannot say the smallest part which I feel.
 
 Who could have supposed that our God would have been so
 merciful as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and
 polluted state?
 
 Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings
 to destroy his church.
 
 Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction,
 yea, why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us,
 and doom us to eternal despair?
 
 Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought.
 Behold, he did not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great
 mercy hath brought us over that everlasting gulf of death and
 misery, even to the salvation of our souls.
 
 And now behold, my brethren, what natural man is there that
 knoweth these things? I say unto you, there is none that knoweth
 these things, save it be the penitent.
 
 Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth
 forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing--unto
 such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it
 shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed;
 yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls
 to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these
 our brethren to repentance.
 
 Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our
 brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi,
 to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us
 to scorn?
 
 For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the
 Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye
 can convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions
 of their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose
 hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been
 spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of
 a transgressor from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember
 that this was their language.
 
 And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them,
 that we destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest
 they overrun us and destroy us.
 
 But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness
 not with the intent to destroy our brethren, but with the intent
 that perhaps we might save some few of their souls.
 
 Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn
 back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy
 brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine
 afflictions, and I will give unto you success.
 
 And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them;
 and we have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered
 every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house,
 relying upon the mercies of the world--not upon the mercies of
 the world alone but upon the mercies of God.
 
 And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we
 have taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them
 upon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and
 their synagogues and taught them; and we have been cast out, and
 mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have
 been stoned, and taken and bound with strong cords, and cast into
 prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been
 delivered again.
 
 And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this,
 that perhaps we might be the means of saving some soul; and we
 supposed that our joy would be full if perhaps we could be the
 means of saving some.
 
 Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our
 labors; and are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are many;
 yea, and we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love
 towards their brethren and also towards us.
 
 For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even
 to take the life of their enemy; and they have buried their
 weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards
 their brethren.
 
 And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love
 in all the land? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not,
 even among the Nephites.
 
 For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren;
 they would not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold how
 many of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they
 have gone to their God, because of their love and of their hatred
 to sin.
 
 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you,
 there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we,
 since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto
 boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all
 understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful
 Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe
 on his name.
 
 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my
 life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption
 from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has
 been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of
 Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I
 say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us,
 wanderers in a strange land.
 
 Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people,
 whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and
 his bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy,
 and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my
 God forever. Amen.
 
 
 Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites who had gone to
 war against the Nephites had found, after their many struggles to
 destroy them, that it was in vain to seek their destruction, they
 returned again to the land of Nephi.
 
 And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their
 loss, were exceedingly angry. And when they saw that they could
 not seek revenge from the Nephites, they began to stir up the
 people in anger against their brethren, the people of
 Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them.
 
 Now this people again refused to take their arms, and they
 suffered themselves to be slain according to the desires of their
 enemies.
 
 Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction
 among those whom they so dearly beloved, and among those who had
 so dearly beloved them--for they were treated as though they were
 angels sent from God to save them from everlasting
 destruction--therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw this
 great work of destruction, they were moved with compassion, and
 they said unto the king:
 
 Let us gather together this people of the Lord, and let us go
 down to the land of Zarahemla to our brethren the Nephites, and
 flee out of the hands of our enemies, that we be not destroyed.
 
 But the king said unto them: Behold, the Nephites will destroy
 us, because of the many murders and sins we have committed
 against them.
 
 And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he
 say unto us, go down unto our brethren, will ye go?
 
 And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go,
 we will go down unto our brethren, and we will be their slaves
 until we repair unto them the many murders and sins which we have
 committed against them.
 
 But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law of our
 brethren, which was established by my father, that there should
 be any slaves among them; therefore let us go down and rely upon
 the mercies of our brethren.
 
 But the king said unto him: Inquire of the Lord, and if he
 saith unto us go, we will go; otherwise we will perish in the
 land.
 
 And it came to pass that Ammon went and inquired of the Lord,
 and the Lord said unto him:
 
 Get this people out of this land, that they perish not; for
 Satan has great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir
 up the Lamanites to anger against their brethren to slay them;
 therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this people
 in this generation, for I will preserve them.
 
 And now it came to pass that Ammon went and told the king all
 the words which the Lord had said unto him.
 
 And they gathered together all their people, yea, all the
 people of the Lord, and did gather together all their flocks and
 herds, and departed out of the land, and came into the wilderness
 which divided the land of Nephi from the land of Zarahemla, and
 came over near the borders of the land.
 
 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and
 my brethren will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye
 shall remain here until we return; and we will try the hearts of
 our brethren, whether they will that ye shall come into their
 land.
 
 And it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the
 land, that he and his brethren met Alma, over in the place of
 which has been spoken; and behold, this was a joyful meeting.
 
 Now the joy of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea,
 he was swallowed up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting
 of his strength; and he fell again to the earth.
 
 Now was not this exceeding joy? Behold, this is joy which
 none receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of
 happiness.
 
 Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was truly great,
 and also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold their
 joy was not that to exceed their strength.
 
 And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back
 to the land of Zarahemla; even to his own house. And they went
 and told the chief judge all the things that had happened unto
 them in the land of Nephi, among their brethren, the Lamanites.
 
 And it came to pass that the chief judge sent a proclamation
 throughout all the land, desiring the voice of the people
 concerning the admitting their brethren, who were the people of
 Anti-Nephi-Lehi.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came,
 saying: Behold, we will give up the land of Jershon, which is on
 the east by the sea, which joins the land Bountiful, which is on
 the south of the land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the
 land which we will give unto our brethren for an inheritance.
 
 And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon
 and the land Nephi, that we may protect our brethren in the land
 Jershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their
 fear to take up arms against their brethren lest they should
 commit sin; and this their great fear came because of their sore
 repentance which they had, on account of their many murders and
 their awful wickedness.
 
 And now behold, this will we do unto our brethren, that they
 may inherit the land Jershon; and we will guard them from their
 enemies with our armies, on condition that they will give us a
 portion of their substance to assist us that we may maintain our
 armies.
 
 Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he
 returned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with
 him, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and
 made known unto them all these things. And Alma also related
 unto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and his brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them.
 And they went down into the land of Jershon, and took possession
 of the land of Jershon; and they were called by the Nephites the
 people of Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by that name
 ever after.
 
 And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered
 among the people who were of the church of God. And they were
 also distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards
 men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things;
 and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.
 
 And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren
 with the greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed
 upon to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did
 look upon death with any degree of terror, for their hope and
 views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore, death was
 swallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it.
 
 Therefore, they would suffer death in the most aggravating
 and distressing manner which could be inflicted by their
 brethren, before they would take the sword or cimeter to smite
 them.
 
 And thus they were a zealous and beloved people, a highly
 favored people of the Lord.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were
 established in the land of Jershon, and a church also established
 in the land of Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set
 round about the land of Jershon, yea, in all the borders round
 about the land of Zarahemla; behold the armies of the Lamanites
 had followed their brethren into the wilderness.
 
 And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one
 as never had been known among all the people in the land from the
 time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the
 Lamanites were slain and scattered abroad.
 
 Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter among the
 people of Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites were driven and
 scattered, and the people of Nephi returned again to their land.
 
 And now this was a time that there was a great mourning and
 lamentation heard throughout all the land, among all the people
 of Nephi--
 
 Yea, the cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also
 of fathers mourning for their sons, and the daughter for the
 brother, yea, the brother for the father; and thus the cry of
 mourning was heard among all of them, mourning for their kindred
 who had been slain.
 
 And now surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of
 solemnity, and a time of much fasting and prayer.
 
 And thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges
 over the people of Nephi;
 
 And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their
 journeyings in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land,
 their sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehensible
 joy, and the reception and safety of the brethren in the land of
 Jershon. And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless
 their souls forever.
 
 And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the
 Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the
 Lamanites; and the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is
 ended.
 
 And from the first year to the fifteenth has brought to pass
 the destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has brought to
 pass an awful scene of bloodshed.
 
 And the bodies of many thousands are laid low in the earth,
 while the bodies of many thousands are moldering in heaps upon
 the face of the earth; yea, and many thousands are mourning for
 the loss of their kindred, because they have reason to fear,
 according to the promises of the Lord, that they are consigned to
 a state of endless wo.
 
 While many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of
 their kindred, yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and even
 know, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are raised
 to dwell at the right hand of God, in a state of never-ending
 happiness.
 
 And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of
 sin and transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by
 the cunning plans which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of
 men.
 
 And thus we see the great call of diligence of men to labor
 in the vineyards of the Lord; and thus we see the great reason of
 sorrow, and also of rejoicing--sorrow because of death and
 destruction among men, and joy because of the light of Christ
 unto life.
 
 
 O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart,
 that I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a
 voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!
 
 Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of
 thunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should
 repent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow
 upon all the face of the earth.
 
 But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to
 be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.
 
 I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a
 just God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their
 desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that
 he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are
 unalterable, according to their wills, whether they be unto
 salvation or unto destruction.
 
 Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men;
 he that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that
 knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his
 desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or
 remorse of conscience.
 
 Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more
 than to perform the work to which I have been called?
 
 Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak
 unto all the ends of the earth?
 
 For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own
 nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he
 seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord
 doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.
 
 I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in
 it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord
 hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may
 be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to
 repentance; and this is my joy.
 
 And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent,
 and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with
 joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even
 that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his
 merciful arm which he extended towards me.
 
 Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I
 surely do know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and
 by this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of
 Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them
 out of bondage.
 
 Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers;
 and that same God who delivered them out of the hands of the
 Egyptians did deliver them out of bondage.
 
 Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them;
 yea, and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to
 preach the word unto this people, and hath given me much success,
 in the which my joy is full.
 
 But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more
 full because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to
 the land of Nephi.
 
 Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth
 much fruit; and how great shall be their reward!
 
 Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul
 is carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as
 it were, so great is my joy.
 
 And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may
 sit down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are
 the fruit of their labors that they may go no more out, but that
 they may praise him forever. And may God grant that it may be
 done according to my words, even as I have spoken. Amen.
 
 
 Behold, now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon
 were established in the land of Jershon, yea, and also after the
 Lamanites were driven out of the land, and their dead were buried
 by the people of the land--
 
 Now their dead were not numbered because of the greatness of
 their numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites
 numbered--but it came to pass after they had buried their dead,
 and also after the days of fasting, and mourning, and prayer,
 (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over
 the people of Nephi) there began to be continual peace throughout
 all the land.
 
 Yea, and the people did observe to keep the commandments of
 the Lord; and they were strict in observing the ordinances of
 God, according to the law of Moses; for they were taught to keep
 the law of Moses until it should be fulfilled.
 
 And thus the people did have no disturbance in all the
 sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of
 Nephi.
 
 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the
 seventeenth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual
 peace.
 
 But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year,
 there came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was
 Anti-Christ, for he began to preach unto the people against the
 prophecies which had been spoken by the prophets, concerning the
 coming of Christ.
 
 Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was
 strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a
 law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.
 
 For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will
 serve.
 
 Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or
 rather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him;
 but if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.
 
 But if he murdered he was punished unto death; and if he
 robbed he was also punished; and if he stole he was also
 punished; and if he committed adultery he was also punished; yea,
 for all this wickedness they were punished.
 
 For there was a law that men should be judged according to
 their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's
 belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which
 he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.
 
 And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law
 could have no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that
 there should be no Christ. And after this manner did he preach,
 saying:
 
 O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why
 do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things? Why do ye look
 for a Christ? For no man can know of anything which is to come.
 
 Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say
 are handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish
 traditions of your fathers.
 
 How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye cannot know of
 things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there
 shall be a Christ.
 
 Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins.
 
 But behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this
 derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your
 fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are
 not so.
 
 And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them
 that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but
 every man fared in this life according to the management of the
 creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius,
 and that every man conquered according to his strength; and
 whatsoever a man did was no crime.
 
 And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of
 many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness,
 yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit
 whoredoms--telling them that when a man was dead, that was the
 end thereof.
 
 Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach
 these things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people
 of the Lamanites.
 
 But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for
 they took him, and bound him, and carried him before Ammon, who
 was a high priest over that people.
 
 And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried
 out of the land. And he came over into the land of Gideon, and
 began to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much
 success, for he was taken and bound and carried before the high
 priest, and also the chief judge over the land.
 
 And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why
 do ye go about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach
 this people that there shall be no Christ, to interrupt their
 rejoicings? Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the
 holy prophets?
 
 Now the high priest's name was Giddonah. And Korihor said
 unto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your
 fathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind
 themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances
 which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and
 authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not
 lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.
 
 Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they
 are in bondage. Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true.
 Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.
 
 Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people,
 because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a
 child is not guilty because of its parents.
 
 And ye also say that Christ shall come. But behold, I say
 that ye do not know that there shall be a Christ. And ye say
 also that he shall be slain for the sins of the world--
 
 And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish
 traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires;
 and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may
 glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst
 not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their
 rights and privileges.
 
 Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest
 they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to
 their desires, and have brought them to believe, by their
 traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and
 their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do
 according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say
 is God--a being who never has been seen or known, who never was
 nor ever will be.
 
 Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness
 of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even
 against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they
 caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into
 the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla,
 that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was
 governor over all the land.
 
 And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and
 the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the
 land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.
 
 And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and
 did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of
 leading away the people after the silly traditions of their
 fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.
 
 Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut
 ourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have
 labored even from the commencement of the reign of the judges
 until now, with mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my
 many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto
 my people.
 
 And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in
 the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for
 my labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the
 judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law
 for our time.
 
 And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the
 church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it
 were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy
 of our brethren?
 
 Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get
 gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain?
 And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes
 such joy in their hearts?
 
 And Korihor answered him, Yea.
 
 And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a
 God?
 
 And he answered, Nay.
 
 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a
 God, and also deny the Christ? For behold, I say unto you, I
 know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come.
 
 And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that
 Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be
 your word only.
 
 But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these
 things are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto
 you that they are true; and will ye deny them? Believest thou
 that these things are true?
 
 Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed
 with a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that
 it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you,
 and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy
 the children of God.
 
 And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign,
 that I may be convinced that THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI
 HIS REIGN AND MINISTRY
 An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and his four sons, being
 called, (beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi.
 The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem,
 because he prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity
 and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days' journey
 into the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren
 and returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the
 Jews. The account of their sufferings. They take the daughters of
 Ishmael to wife. They take their families and depart into the
 wilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness.
 The course of their travels. They come to the large waters.
 Nephi's brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and
 buildeth a ship. They call the name of the place Bountiful. They
 cross the large waters into the promised land, and so forth. This
 is according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, I,
 Nephi, wrote this record.
 
 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was
 taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen
 many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having
 been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a
 great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God,
 therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.
 
 Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which
 consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the
 Egyptians.
 
 And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it
 with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
 
 For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of
 the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having
 dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there
 came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must
 repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.
 
 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went
 forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in
 behalf of his people.
 
 And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a
 pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and
 heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he
 did quake and tremble exceedingly.
 
 And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at
 Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with
 the Spirit and the things which he had seen.
 
 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away
 in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he
 saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless
 concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising
 their God.
 
 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the
 midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of
 the sun at noon-day.
 
 And he also saw twelve others following him, and their
 brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.
 
 And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth;
 and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him
 a book, and bade him that he should read.
 
 And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the
 Spirit of the Lord.
 
 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen
 thine abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read
 concerning Jerusalem--that it should be destroyed, and the
 inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many
 should be carried away captive into Babylon.
 
 And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen
 many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto
 the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God
 Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and
 goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth,
 and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who
 come unto thee that they shall perish!
 
 And after this manner was the language of my father in the
 praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole
 heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea,
 which the Lord had shown unto him.
 
 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things
 which my father hath written, for he hath written many things
 which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written
 many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of
 which I shall not make a full account.
 
 But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days.
 Behold, I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon
 plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I
 have abridged the record of my father then will I make an account
 of mine own life.
 
 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord
 had shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea,
 concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth
 among the people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto them
 concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.
 
 And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the
 things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of
 their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that
 the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he
 read in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of the
 Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.
 
 And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with
 him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast
 out, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that
 they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto
 you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom
 he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even
 unto the power of deliverance.
 
 
 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my
 father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou
 Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because
 thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things
 which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in
 a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the
 wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the
 Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.
 
 And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And
 he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold,
 and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with
 him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and
 departed into the wilderness.
 
 And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea;
 and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer
 the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family,
 which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who
 were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.
 
 And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in
 the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a
 river of water.
 
 And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made
 an offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.
 
 And it came to pass that he called the name of the river,
 Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the
 borders near the mouth thereof.
 
 And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied
 into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O
 that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running
 into the fountain of all righteousness!
 
 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like
 unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping
 the commandments of the Lord!
 
 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and
 Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many things against their
 father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of
 the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance,
 and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to
 perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because
 of the foolish imaginations of his heart.
 
 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur
 against their father. And they did murmur because they knew not
 the dealings of that God who had created them.
 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city,
 could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And
 they were like unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to
 take away the life of my father.
 
 And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the
 valley of Lemuel, with power, being filled with the Spirit, until
 their frames did shake before him. And he did confound them,
 that they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he
 commanded them.
 
 And my father dwelt in a tent.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young,
 nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great
 desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry
 unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my
 heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by
 my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my
 brothers.
 
 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which
 the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came
 to pass that he believed in my words.
 
 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my
 words; and being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts
 I cried unto the Lord for them.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying:
 Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast
 sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.
 
 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall
 prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land
 which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above
 all other lands.
 
 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they
 shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.
 
 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt
 be made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.
 
 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, I
 will curse them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no
 power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also.
 
 And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a
 scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of
 remembrance.
 
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with
 the Lord, to the tent of my father.
 
 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I
 have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me
 that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.
 
 For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a
 genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of
 brass.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy
 brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records,
 and bring them down hither into the wilderness.
 
 And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing
 which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it
 of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.
 
 Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord,
 because thou hast not murmured.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will
 go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know
 that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men,
 save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the
 thing which he commandeth them.
 
 And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words
 he was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of
 the Lord.
 
 And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the
 wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.
 
 And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of
 Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.
 
 And we cast lots--who of us should go in unto the house of
 Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and
 Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as
 he sat in his house.
 
 And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon
 the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father.
 
 And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust
 him out from his presence; and he would not that he should have
 the records. Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a
 robber, and I will slay thee.
 
 But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which
 Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly
 sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in
 the wilderness.
 
 But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as
 we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness
 until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath
 commanded us.
 
 Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of
 the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father's
 inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner
 of riches. And all this he hath done because of the commandments
 of the Lord.
 
 For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the
 wickedness of the people.
 
 For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets.
 Wherefore, if my father should dwell in the land after he hath
 been commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also
 perish. Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the
 land.
 
 And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these
 records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of
 our fathers;
 
 And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have
 been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have
 been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since
 the world began, even down unto this present time.
 
 And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I
 persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the
 commandments of God.
 
 And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our
 inheritance, and we did gather together our gold, and our silver,
 and our precious things.
 
 And after we had gathered these things together, we went up
 again unto the house of Laban.
 
 And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired
 him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven
 upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our
 gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.
 
 And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and
 that it was exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch
 that he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he
 might obtain our property.
 
 And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of
 Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it
 fell into the hands of Laban.
 
 And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the
 servants of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in
 the cavity of a rock.
 
 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also
 with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the
 words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard
 words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even
 with a rod.
 
 And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an
 angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto
 them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod?
 Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you,
 and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to
 Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.
 
 And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.
 
 And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again
 began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will
 deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he
 can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?
 
 
 And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let
 us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping
 the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all
 the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea,
 or even than his tens of thousands?
 
 Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for
 he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided
 hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of
 captivity, on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow
 and were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.
 
 Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an
 angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go
 up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to
 destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.
 
 Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and
 did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up
 until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.
 
 And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide
 themselves without the walls. And after they had hid themselves,
 I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of
 Laban.
 
 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things
 which I should do.
 
 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house
 of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before
 me, for he was drunken with wine.
 
 And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.
 
 And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath
 thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the
 workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the
 blade thereof was of the most precious steel.
 
 And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that
 I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time
 have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I
 might not slay him.
 
 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath
 delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had
 sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken
 unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our
 property.
 
 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay
 him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;
 
 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his
 righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than
 that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.
 
 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered
 the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness,
 saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments,
 they shall prosper in the land of promise.
 
 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the
 commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they
 should have the law.
 
 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of
 brass.
 
 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my
 hands for this cause--that I might obtain the records according
 to his commandments.
 
 Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban
 by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own
 sword.
 
 And after I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I
 took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea,
 even every whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.
 
 And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of
 Laban. And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban,
 behold, I saw the servant of Laban who had the keys of the
 treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he
 should go with me into the treasury.
 
 And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the
 garments and also the sword girded about my loins.
 
 And he spake unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he
 knowing that his master, Laban, had been out by night among them.
 
 And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban.
 
 And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings,
 which were upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, who
 were without the walls.
 
 And I also bade him that he should follow me.
 
 And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church,
 and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he
 did follow me.
 
 And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the
 Jews, as I went forth unto my brethren, who were without the
 walls.
 
 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly
 frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before
 my presence; for they supposed it was Laban, and that he had
 slain me and had sought to take away their lives also.
 
 And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did
 hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.
 
 And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my
 brethren he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before
 me and return to the city of Jerusalem.
 
 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also
 having received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize
 upon the servant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.
 
 And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would
 hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so
 that if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his life.
 
 And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not
 fear; that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go
 down in the wilderness with us.
 
 And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath
 commanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in
 keeping the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go
 down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with
 us.
 
 And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words
 which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he
 promised that he would go down into the wilderness unto our
 father. Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would
 tarry with us from that time forth.
 
 Now we were desirous that he should tarry with us for this
 cause, that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into
 the wilderness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.
 
 And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto us,
 our fears did cease concerning him.
 
 And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the
 servant of Laban, and departed into the wilderness, and journeyed
 unto the tent of our father.
 
 
 And it came to pass that after we had come down into the
 wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and
 also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had
 mourned because of us.
 
 For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness;
 and she also had complained against my father, telling him that
 he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth
 from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we
 perish in the wilderness.
 
 And after this manner of language had my mother complained
 against my father.
 
 And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying:
 I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the
 things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of
 God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my
 brethren.
 
 But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which
 things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver
 my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto
 us in the wilderness.
 
 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort
 my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the
 wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of
 the Jews.
 
 And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold
 their joy was full, and my mother was comforted.
 
 And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord
 hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I
 also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and
 delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power
 whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath
 commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak.
 
 And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did
 offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave
 thanks unto the God of Israel.
 
 And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my
 father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the
 plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.
 
 And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses,
 which gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of
 Adam and Eve, who were our first parents;
 
 And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down
 to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;
 
 And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the
 beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of
 Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the
 mouth of Jeremiah.
 
 And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the
 plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew
 that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was
 the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved
 by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father,
 Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.
 
 And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land
 of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.
 
 And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his
 fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he
 and his fathers had kept the records.
 
 And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled
 with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed--
 
 That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations,
 kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.
 
 Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never
 perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he
 prophesied many things concerning his seed.
 
 And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept
 the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.
 
 And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded
 us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea,
 even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the
 commandments of the Lord unto our children.
 
 Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry
 them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land
 of promise.
 
 
 And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in
 this part of my record; neither at any time shall I give it after
 upon these plates which I am writing; for it is given in the
 record which has been kept by my father; wherefore, I do not
 write it in this work.
 
 For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.
 
 And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full
 account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be
 written upon these plates, for I desire the room that I may write
 of the things of God.
 
 For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to
 come unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
 of Jacob, and be saved.
 
 Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do
 not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto
 those who are not of the world.
 
 Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they
 shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth
 unto the children of men.
 
 
 And now I would that ye might know, that after my father,
 Lehi, had made an end of prophesying concerning his seed, it came
 to pass that the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was
 not meet for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the
 wilderness alone; but that his sons should take daughters to
 wife, that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of
 promise.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi,
 and my brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem,
 and bring down Ishmael and his family into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again, with my
 brethren, go forth into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem.
 
 And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael,
 and we did gain favor in the sight of Ishmael, insomuch that we
 did speak unto him the words of the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of
 Ishmael, and also his household, insomuch that they took their
 journey with us down into the wilderness to the tent of our
 father.
 
 And it came to pass that as we journeyed in the wilderness,
 behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and
 the two sons of Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us;
 yea, against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father, Ishmael, and
 his wife, and his three other daughters.
 
 And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they were desirous
 to return unto the land of Jerusalem.
 
 And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness of their
 hearts, therefore I spake unto them, saying, yea, even unto Laman
 and unto Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it
 that ye are so hard in your hearts, and so blind in your minds,
 that ye have need that I, your younger brother, should speak unto
 you, yea, and set an example for you?
 
 How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the
 Lord?
 
 How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel
 of the Lord?
 
 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten what great things
 the Lord hath done for us, in delivering us out of the hands of
 Laban, and also that we should obtain the record?
 
 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is
 able to do all things according to his will, for the children of
 men, if it so be that they exercise faith in him? Wherefore, let
 us be faithful to him.
 
 And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain
 the land of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that
 the word of the Lord shall be fulfilled concerning the
 destruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath
 spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.
 
 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive
 with them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and
 Jeremiah have they cast into prison. And they have sought to
 take away the life of my father, insomuch that they have driven
 him out of the land.
 
 Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto
 Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them. And now, if ye have
 choice, go up to the land, and remember the words which I speak
 unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit
 of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.
 
 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these
 words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to
 pass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were
 exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they
 sought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the
 wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts.
 
 But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O
 Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver
 me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that
 I may burst these bands with which I am bound.
 
 And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold,
 the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood
 before my brethren, and I spake unto them again.
 
 And it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and
 sought to lay hands upon me; but behold, one of the daughters of
 Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of
 Ishmael, did plead with my brethren, insomuch that they did
 soften their hearts; and they did cease striving to take away my
 life.
 
 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of
 their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and
 did plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that
 they had done against me.
 
 And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that
 they had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto
 the Lord their God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that
 they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we
 did again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.
 
 And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of
 our father. And after I and my brethren and all the house of
 Ishmael had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give
 thanks unto the Lord their God; and they did offer sacrifice and
 burnt offerings unto him.
 
 
 And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner
 of seeds of every kind, both of grain of every kind, and also of
 the seeds of fruit of every kind.
 
 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the
 wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have dreamed a
 dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision.
 
 And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have
 reason to rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi and also of Sam;
 for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their
 seed, will be saved.
 
 But behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of
 you; for behold, methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary
 wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a
 white robe; and he came and stood before me.
 
 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow
 him.
 
 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself
 that I was in a dark and dreary waste.
 
 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in
 darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy
 on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.
 
 And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld
 a large and spacious field.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was
 desirable to make one happy.
 
 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the
 fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all
 that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit
 thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever
 seen.
 
 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with
 exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my
 family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was
 desirable above all other fruit.
 
 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might
 discover my family also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran
 along, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the
 fruit.
 
 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the
 head thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof I beheld
 your mother Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they
 knew not whither they should go.
 
 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did
 say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me,
 and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other
 fruit.
 
 And it came to pass that they did come unto me and partake of
 the fruit also.
 
 And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel
 should come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine
 eyes towards the head of the river, that perhaps I might see
 them.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would not come
 unto me and partake of the fruit.
 
 And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of
 the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.
 
 And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along
 by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it
 also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious
 field, as if it had been a world.
 
 And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were
 pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto
 the tree by which I stood.
 
 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in
 the path which led to the tree.
 
 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea,
 even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they
 who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they
 wandered off and were lost.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward,
 and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of
 iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness,
 clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and
 partake of the fruit of the tree.
 
 And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did
 cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed.
 
 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other
 side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it
 stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.
 
 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male
 and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and
 they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers
 towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.
 
 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed,
 because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away
 into forbidden paths and were lost.
 
 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.
 
 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes
 pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the
 rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually
 holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell
 down and partook of the fruit of the tree.
 
 And he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards
 that great and spacious building.
 
 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of
 the fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in
 strange roads.
 
 And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange
 building. And after they did enter into that building they did
 point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of
 the fruit also; but we heeded them not.
 
 These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them,
 had fallen away.
 
 And Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, said my
 father.
 
 And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words
 of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because
 of these things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared
 for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off
 from the presence of the Lord.
 
 And he did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender
 parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the
 Lord would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my
 father did preach unto them.
 
 And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto
 them of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the
 Lord; and he did cease speaking unto them.
 
 
 And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak,
 as he dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel, and also a great
 many more things, which cannot be written upon these plates.
 
 And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they
 are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the
 history of my people; for the plates upon which I make a full
 account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore,
 they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and
 these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.
 
 Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I
 should make these plates, for the special purpose that there
 should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people.
 
 Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the
 reign of the kings, and the wars and contentions of my people;
 wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry; and
 the other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings
 and the wars and contentions of my people.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for
 a wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not.
 
 But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore,
 he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children
 of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all
 his words. And thus it is. Amen.
 
 
 And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates
 of my proceedings, and my reign and ministry; wherefore, to
 proceed with mine account, I must speak somewhat of the things of
 my father, and also of my brethren.
 
 For behold, it came to pass after my father had made an end of
 speaking the words of his dream, and also of exhorting them to
 all diligence, he spake unto them concerning the Jews--
 
 That after they should be destroyed, even that great city
 Jerusalem, and many be carried away captive into Babylon,
 according to the own due time of the Lord, they should return
 again, yea, even be brought back out of captivity; and after they
 should be brought back out of captivity they should possess again
 the land of their inheritance.
 
 Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left
 Jerusalem, a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the
 Jews--even a Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world.
 
 And he also spake concerning the prophets, how great a number
 had testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of whom
 he had spoken, or this Redeemer of the world.
 
 Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state,
 and ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer.
 
 And he spake also concerning a prophet who should come before
 the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord--
 
 Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness:
 Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for
 there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier
 than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And
 much spake my father concerning this thing.
 
 And my father said he should baptize in Bethabara, beyond
 Jordan; and he also said he should baptize with water; even that
 he should baptize the Messiah with water.
 
 And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should
 behold and bear record that he had baptized the Lamb of God, who
 should take away the sins of the world.
 
 And it came to pass after my father had spoken these words he
 spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be
 preached among the Jews, and also concerning the dwindling of the
 Jews in unbelief. And after they had slain the Messiah, who
 should come, and after he had been slain he should rise from the
 dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto
 the Gentiles.
 
 Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and
 also concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared
 like unto an olive-tree, whose branches should be broken off and
 should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.
 
 Wherefore, he said it must needs be that we should be led
 with one accord into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of
 the word of the Lord, that we should be scattered upon all the
 face of the earth.
 
 And after the house of Israel should be scattered they should
 be gathered together again; or, in fine, after the Gentiles had
 received the fulness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the
 olive-tree, or the remnants of the house of Israel, should be
 grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their
 Lord and their Redeemer.
 
 And after this manner of language did my father prophesy and
 speak unto my brethren, and also many more things which I do not
 write in this book; for I have written as many of them as were
 expedient for me in mine other book.
 
 And all these things, of which I have spoken, were done as my
 father dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel.
 
 And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the
 words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a
 vision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the
 Holy Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of
 God--and the Son of God was the Messiah who should come--I,
 Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of
 these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift
 of God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times
 of old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the
 children of men.
 
 For he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the
 way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if
 it so be that they repent and come unto him.
 
 For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries
 of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy
 Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in
 times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the
 Lord is one eternal round.
 
 Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be
 brought into judgment.
 
 Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of
 your probation, then ye are found unclean before the
 judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God;
 wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.
 
 And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak these
 things, and deny them not.
 
 
 For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things
 that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to
 make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was
 caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly
 high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I
 never had before set my foot.
 
 And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?
 
 And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.
 
 And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father
 saw the tree of which he hath spoken?
 
 And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of
 my father.
 
 And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a
 loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for
 he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed
 art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most
 high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast
 desired.
 
 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign,
 that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which
 thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of
 heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him
 ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.
 
 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look! And I
 looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my
 father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea,
 exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the
 whiteness of the driven snow.
 
 And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the
 Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is
 precious above all.
 
 And he said unto me: What desirest thou?
 
 And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof--for
 I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in
 the form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the
 Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with
 another.
 
 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look! And I looked
 as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from
 before my presence.
 
 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city
 of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of
 Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she
 was exceedingly fair and white.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel
 came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what
 beholdest thou?
 
 And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above
 all other virgins.
 
 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?
 
 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children;
 nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.
 
 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is
 the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away
 in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit
 for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!
 
 And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in
 her arms.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even
 the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the
 tree which thy father saw?
 
 And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which
 sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men;
 wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.
 
 And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the
 soul.
 
 And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look!
 And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the
 children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship
 him.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which
 my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the
 fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters
 are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that
 the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.
 
 And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the
 condescension of God!
 
 And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my
 father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should
 prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and
 was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the
 heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and
 abide upon him in the form of a dove.
 
 And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people,
 in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered
 together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from
 among them.
 
 And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came
 to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my
 face, and I saw them not.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again,
 saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again,
 and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they
 did minister unto them.
 
 And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and
 I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men.
 And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were
 afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and
 unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things
 unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God;
 and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again,
 saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he
 was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was
 judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.
 
 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and
 slain for the sins of the world.
 
 And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth,
 that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of
 the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the
 Lord.
 
 And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I
 beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto
 the building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord
 spake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom
 thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together
 to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the
 great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it
 fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel
 of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the
 destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that
 shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Look, and
 behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren. And I looked
 and beheld the land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of
 people, yea, even as it were in number as many as the sand of the
 sea.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld multitudes gathered together
 to battle, one against the other; and I beheld wars, and rumors
 of wars, and great slaughters with the sword among my people.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld many generations pass away,
 after the manner of wars and contentions in the land; and I
 beheld many cities, yea, even that I did not number them.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw a mist of darkness on the face
 of the land of promise; and I saw lightnings, and I heard
 thunderings, and earthquakes, and all manner of tumultuous
 noises; and I saw the earth and the rocks, that they rent; and I
 saw mountains tumbling into pieces; and I saw the plains of the
 earth, that they were broken up; and I saw many cities that they
 were sunk; and I saw many that they were burned with fire; and I
 saw many that did tumble to the earth, because of the quaking
 thereof.
 
 And it came to pass after I saw these things, I saw the vapor
 of darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and
 behold, I saw multitudes who had not fallen because of the great
 and terrible judgments of the Lord.
 
 And I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out
 of heaven; and he came down and showed himself unto them.
 
 And I also saw and bear record that the Holy Ghost fell upon
 twelve others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen.
 
 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the twelve
 disciples of the Lamb, who are chosen to minister unto thy seed.
 
 And he said unto me: Thou rememberest the twelve apostles of
 the Lamb? Behold they are they who shall judge the twelve tribes
 of Israel; wherefore, the twelve ministers of thy seed shall be
 judged of them; for ye are of the house of Israel.
 
 And these twelve ministers whom thou beholdest shall judge
 thy seed. And, behold, they are righteous forever; for because
 of their faith in the Lamb of God their garments are made white
 in his blood.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Look! And I looked, and beheld
 three generations pass away in righteousness; and their garments
 were white even like unto the Lamb of God. And the angel said
 unto me: These are made white in the blood of the Lamb, because
 of their faith in him.
 
 And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth generation who
 passed away in righteousness.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw the multitudes of the earth
 gathered together.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold thy seed, and also the
 seed of thy brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the people of my
 seed gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my
 brethren; and they were gathered together to battle.
 
 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the fountain of
 filthy water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of which
 he spake; and the depths thereof are the depths of hell.
 
 And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil,
 which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children
 of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish
 and are lost.
 
 And the large and spacious building, which thy father saw, is
 vain imaginations and the pride of the children of men. And a
 great and a terrible gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of
 the justice of the Eternal God, and the Messiah who is the Lamb
 of God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record, from the beginning
 of the world until this time, and from this time henceforth and
 forever.
 
 And while the angel spake these words, I beheld and saw that
 the seed of my brethren did contend against my seed, according to
 the word of the angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and
 the temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my
 brethren did overpower the people of my seed.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld, and saw the people of the
 seed of my brethren that they had overcome my seed; and they went
 forth in multitudes upon the face of the land.
 
 And I saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw
 wars and rumors of wars among them; and in wars and rumors of
 wars I saw many generations pass away.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold these shall dwindle in
 unbelief.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld, after they had dwindled in
 unbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people,
 full of idleness and all manner of abominations.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying:
 Look! And I looked and beheld many nations and kingdoms.
 
 And the angel said unto me: What beholdest thou? And I said:
 I behold many nations and kingdoms.
 
 And he said unto me: These are the nations and kingdoms of the
 Gentiles.
 
 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the
 Gentiles the formation of a great church.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold the formation of a church
 which is most abominable above all other churches, which slayeth
 the saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down,
 and yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into
 captivity.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable
 church; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it.
 
 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and
 fine-twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw
 many harlots.
 
 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the
 silver, and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine-twined
 linen, and the precious clothing, and the harlots, are the
 desires of this great and abominable church.
 
 And also for the praise of the world do they destroy the
 saints of God, and bring them down into captivity.
 
 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld many waters; and
 they divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Behold the
 wrath of God is upon the seed of thy brethren.
 
 And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was
 separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I
 beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the
 man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed
 of my brethren, who were in the promised land.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it
 wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of
 captivity, upon the many waters.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the
 Gentiles upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God,
 that it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered
 before the Gentiles and were smitten.
 
 And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the
 Gentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their
 inheritance; and I beheld that they were white, and exceedingly
 fair and beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles
 who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before
 the Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them.
 
 And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered
 together upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle
 against them.
 
 And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also
 that the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered
 together against them to battle.
 
 And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of
 captivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of
 all other nations.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did
 prosper in the land; and I beheld a book, and it was carried
 forth among them.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Knowest thou the meaning of the
 book?
 
 And I said unto him: I know not.
 
 And he said: Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew.
 And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he said unto me: The book that thou
 beholdest is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants
 of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel; and it
 also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy prophets; and
 it is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the plates
 of brass, save there are not so many; nevertheless, they contain
 the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of
 Israel; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the Gentiles.
 
 And the angel of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast beheld that
 the book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it
 proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew it contained the fulness
 of the gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve apostles bear
 record; and they bear record according to the truth which is in
 the Lamb of God.
 
 Wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews in purity unto
 the Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God.
 
 And after they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of
 the Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the
 formation of a great and abominable church, which is most
 abominable above all other churches; for behold, they have taken
 away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and
 most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they
 taken away.
 
 And all this have they done that they might pervert the right
 ways of the Lord, that they might blind the eyes and harden the
 hearts of the children of men.
 
 Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth
 through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there
 are many plain and precious things taken away from the book,
 which is the book of the Lamb of God.
 
 And after these plain and precious things were taken away it
 goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and after it
 goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles, yea, even
 across the many waters which thou hast seen with the Gentiles
 which have gone forth out of captivity, thou seest--because of
 the many plain and precious things which have been taken out of
 the book, which were plain unto the understanding of the children
 of men, according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of
 God--because of these things which are taken away out of the
 gospel of the Lamb, an exceedingly great many do stumble, yea,
 insomuch that Satan hath great power over them.
 
 Nevertheless, thou beholdest that the Gentiles who have gone
 forth out of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of
 God above all other nations, upon the face of the land which is
 choice above all other lands, which is the land that the Lord God
 hath covenanted with thy father that his seed should have for the
 land of their inheritance; wherefore, thou seest that the Lord
 God will not suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the
 mixture of thy seed, which are among thy brethren.
 
 Neither will he suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy the
 seed of thy brethren.
 
 Neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall
 forever remain in that awful state of blindness, which thou
 beholdest they are in, because of the plain and most precious
 parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that
 abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen.
 
 Wherefore saith the Lamb of God: I will be merciful unto the
 Gentiles, unto the visiting of the remnant of the house of Israel
 in great judgment.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me,
 saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after I have visited the
 remnant of the house of Israel--and this remnant of whom I speak
 is the seed of thy father--wherefore, after I have visited them
 in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and
 after the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most
 plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have
 been kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of
 harlots, saith the Lamb--I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in
 that day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in mine own
 power, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious,
 saith the Lamb.
 
 For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy
 seed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister
 unto them, which shall be plain and precious; and after thy seed
 shall be destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of
 thy brethren, behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth
 unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb.
 
 And in them shall be written my gospel, saith the Lamb, and
 my rock and my salvation.
 
 And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at
 that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy
 Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at
 the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of
 the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great
 joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of
 my brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had
 proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew, that it came forth
 from the Gentiles unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren.
 
 And after it had come forth unto them I beheld other books,
 which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto
 them, unto the convincing of the Gentiles and the remnant of the
 seed of my brethren, and also the Jews who were scattered upon
 all the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and
 of the twelve apostles of the Lamb are true.
 
 And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records,
 which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the
 truth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb,
 and shall make known the plain and precious things which have
 been taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds,
 tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the
 Eternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men
 must come unto him, or they cannot be saved.
 
 And they must come according to the words which shall be
 established by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb
 shall be made known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the
 records of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore they both
 shall be established in one; for there is one God and one
 Shepherd over all the earth.
 
 And the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all
 nations, both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles; and after
 he has manifested himself unto the Jews and also unto the
 Gentiles, then he shall manifest himself unto the Gentiles and
 also unto the Jews, and the last shall be first, and the first
 shall be last.
 
 
 And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken
 unto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself
 unto them in word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the
 taking away of their stumbling blocks--
 
 And harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God, they
 shall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, they shall
 be numbered among the house of Israel; and they shall be a
 blessed people upon the promised land forever; they shall be no
 more brought down into captivity; and the house of Israel shall
 no more be confounded.
 
 And that great pit, which hath been digged for them by that
 great and abominable church, which was founded by the devil and
 his children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to
 hell--yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the
 destruction of men shall be filled by those who digged it, unto
 their utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the
 destruction of the soul, save it be the casting of it into that
 hell which hath no end.
 
 For behold, this is according to the captivity of the devil,
 and also according to the justice of God, upon all those who will
 work wickedness and abomination before him.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi,
 saying: Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent it shall be
 well with them; and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of
 the Lord unto the house of Israel; and thou also hast heard that
 whoso repenteth not must perish.
 
 Therefore, wo be unto the Gentiles if it so be that they
 harden their hearts against the Lamb of God.
 
 For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a
 great and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work
 which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the
 other--either to the convincing of them unto peace and life
 eternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their
 hearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought
 down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally
 and spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of
 which I have spoken.
 
 And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these
 words, he said unto me: Rememberest thou the covenants of the
 Father unto the house of Israel? I said unto him, Yea.
 
 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look, and behold
 that great and abominable church, which is the mother of
 abominations, whose founder is the devil.
 
 And he said unto me: Behold there are save two churches only;
 the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the
 church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church
 of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the
 mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.
 
 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all
 the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion
 over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and
 people.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of
 God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and
 abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless,
 I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God,
 were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions
 upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness
 of the great whore whom I saw.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of
 abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all
 the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight
 against the Lamb of God.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the
 Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of
 the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were
 scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed
 with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was
 poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that
 there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and
 kindreds of the earth.
 
 And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all
 the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the
 angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the
 mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things--
 
 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out
 upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable
 church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at
 that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the
 way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to
 his people who are of the house of Israel.
 
 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying:
 Look!
 
 And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white
 robe.
 
 And the angel said unto me: Behold one of the twelve apostles
 of the Lamb.
 
 Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of these things;
 yea, and also many things which have been.
 
 And he shall also write concerning the end of the world.
 
 Wherefore, the things which he shall write are just and true;
 and behold they are written in the book which thou beheld
 proceeding out of the mouth of the Jew; and at the time they
 proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book
 proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were
 written were plain and pure, and most precious and easy to the
 understanding of all men.
 
 And behold, the things which this apostle of the Lamb shall
 write are many things which thou hast seen; and behold, the
 remainder shalt thou see.
 
 But the things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not
 write; for the Lord God hath ordained the apostle of the Lamb of
 God that he should write them.
 
 And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all
 things, and they have written them; and they are sealed up to
 come forth in their purity, according to the truth which is in
 the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of
 Israel.
 
 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the
 apostle of the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel.
 
 And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the
 remainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the
 things which I have written sufficeth me; and I have written but
 a small part of the things which I saw.
 
 And I bear record that I saw the things which my father saw,
 and the angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.
 
 And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which
 I saw while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the
 things which I saw are not written, the things which I have
 written are true. And thus it is. Amen.
 
 
 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away
 in the spirit, and seen all these things, I returned to the tent
 of my father.
 
 And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren, and they were
 disputing one with another concerning the things my father had
 spoken unto them.
 
 For he truly spake many great things unto them, which were
 hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and
 they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto
 the Lord as they ought.
 
 And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the hardness of their
 hearts, and also, because of the things which I had seen, and
 knew they must unavoidably come to pass because of the great
 wickedness of the children of men.
 
 And it came to pass that I was overcome because of my
 afflictions, for I considered that mine afflictions were great
 above all, because of the destruction of my people, for I had
 beheld their fall.
 
 And it came to pass that after I had received strength I spake
 unto my brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their
 disputations.
 
 And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words which
 our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the
 olive-tree, and also concerning the Gentiles.
 
 And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?
 
 And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord maketh no
 such thing known unto us.
 
 Behold, I said unto them: How is it that ye do not keep the
 commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because
 of the hardness of your hearts?
 
 Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--If
 ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing
 that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments,
 surely these things shall be made known unto you.
 
 Behold, I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared
 unto an olive-tree, by the Spirit of the Lord which was in our
 father; and behold are we not broken off from the house of
 Israel, and are we not a branch of the house of Israel?
 
 And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the
 grafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the
 Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have
 dwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many
 generations after the Messiah shall be manifested in body unto
 the children of men, then shall the fulness of the gospel of the
 Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the
 remnant of our seed--
 
 And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they
 are of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people
 of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge
 of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of
 their Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him;
 wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and
 the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come
 unto him and be saved.
 
 And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise
 unto their everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea,
 at that day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment
 from the true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of
 God?
 
 Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again
 among the house of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a
 natural branch of the olive-tree, into the true olive-tree.
 
 And this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it
 will not come to pass until after they are scattered by the
 Gentiles; and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the
 Gentiles, that the Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for
 the very cause that he shall be rejected of the Jews, or of the
 house of Israel.
 
 Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but
 also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which
 should be fulfilled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord
 made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the
 kindreds of the earth be blessed.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them
 concerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the
 restoration of the Jews in the latter days.
 
 And I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, who spake
 concerning the restoration of the Jews, or of the house of
 Israel; and after they were restored they should no more be
 confounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came
 to pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they
 were pacified and did humble themselves before the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that they did speak unto me again,
 saying: What meaneth this thing which our father saw in a dream?
 What meaneth the tree which he saw?
 
 And I said unto them: It was a representation of the tree of
 life.
 
 And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of iron which our
 father saw, that led to the tree?
 
 And I said unto them that it was the word of God, and whose
 would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it,
 they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the
 fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to
 lead them away to destruction.
 
 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the
 word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of
 my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they
 would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his
 commandments always in all things.
 
 And they said unto me: What meaneth the river of water which
 our father saw?
 
 And I said unto them that the water which my father saw was
 filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things
 that he beheld not the filthiness of the water.
 
 And I said unto them that it was an awful gulf, which
 separated the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the
 saints of God.
 
 And I said unto them that it was a representation of that
 awful hell, which the angel said unto me was prepared for the
 wicked.
 
 And I said unto them that our father also saw that the
 justice of God did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and
 the brightness thereof was like unto the brightness of a flaming
 fire, which ascendeth up unto God forever and ever, and hath no
 end.
 
 And they said unto me: Doth this thing mean the torment of
 the body in the days of probation, or doth it mean the final
 state of the soul after the death of the temporal body, or doth
 it speak of the things which are temporal?
 
 And it came to pass that I said unto them that it was a
 representation of things both temporal and spiritual; for the day
 should come that they must be judged of their works, yea, even
 the works which were done by the temporal body in their days of
 probation.
 
 Wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness they must
 be cast off also, as to the things which are spiritual, which are
 pertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to
 stand before God, to be judged of their works; and if their works
 have been filthiness they must needs be filthy; and if they be
 filthy it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of
 God; if so, the kingdom of God must be filthy also.
 
 But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy,
 and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God;
 wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for
 that which is filthy.
 
 And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful hell of
 which I have spoken, and the devil is the preparator of it;
 wherefore the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the
 kingdom of God, or to be cast out because of that justice of
 which I have spoken.
 
 Wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the righteous, and
 also from that tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and
 most desirable above all other fruits; yea, and it is the
 greatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I spake unto my
 brethren. Amen.
 
 
 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end
 of speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast
 declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.
 
 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I
 had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the
 truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that
 they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty
 taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very
 center.
 
 And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to
 hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk
 uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the
 truth, and say: Thou speakest hard things against us.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my brethren,
 with all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the
 Lord; insomuch that I had joy and great hopes of them, that they
 would walk in the paths of righteousness.
 
 Now, all these things were said and done as my father dwelt in
 a tent in the valley which he called Lemuel.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daughters
 of Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the daughters
 of Ishmael to wife; and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of
 Ishmael to wife.
 
 And thus my father had fulfilled all the commandments of the
 Lord which had been given unto him. And also, I, Nephi, had been
 blessed of the Lord exceedingly.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord spake unto my
 father by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he should
 take his journey into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning,
 and went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he
 beheld upon the ground a round ball of curious workmanship; and
 it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles; and
 the one pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever
 things we should carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder
 of our provisions which the Lord had given unto us; and we did
 take seed of every kind that we might carry into the wilderness.
 
 And it came to pass that we did take our tents and depart
 into the wilderness, across the river Laman.
 
 And it came to pass that we traveled for the space of four
 days, nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our
 tents again; and we did call the name of the place Shazer.
 
 And it came to pass that we did take our bows and our arrows,
 and go forth into the wilderness to slay food for our families;
 and after we had slain food for our families we did return again
 to our families in the wilderness, to the place of Shazer. And
 we did go forth again in the wilderness, following the same
 direction, keeping in the most fertile parts of the wilderness,
 which were in the borders near the Red Sea.
 
 And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many
 days, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and
 our stones and our slings.
 
 And we did follow the directions of the ball, which led us in
 the more fertile parts of the wilderness.
 
 And after we had traveled for the space of many days, we did
 pitch our tents for the space of a time, that we might again rest
 ourselves and obtain food for our families.
 
 And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay
 food, behold, I did break my bow, which was made of fine steel;
 and after I did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with
 me because of the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food.
 
 And it came to pass that we did return without food to our
 families, and being much fatigued, because of their journeying,
 they did suffer much for the want of food.
 
 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of
 Ishmael did begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their
 sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness; and also my father
 began to murmur against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all
 exceedingly sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the
 Lord.
 
 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, having been afflicted with
 my brethren because of the loss of my bow, and their bows having
 lost their springs, it began to be exceedingly difficult, yea,
 insomuch that we could obtain no food.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak much unto my
 brethren, because they had hardened their hearts again, even unto
 complaining against the Lord their God.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a
 bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm
 myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones.
 And I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?
 
 And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they
 had humbled themselves because of my words; for I did say many
 things unto them in the energy of my soul.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
 father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring
 against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the
 depths of sorrow.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him:
 Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written.
 
 And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things
 which were written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble
 exceedingly, and also my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and our
 wives.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which
 were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and
 diligence and heed which we did give unto them.
 
 And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was
 plain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the
 ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to
 time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it.
 
 And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about
 great things.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the
 top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given
 upon the ball.
 
 And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, insomuch
 that I did obtain food for our families.
 
 And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing
 the beasts which I had slain; and now when they beheld that I had
 obtained food, how great was their joy! And it came to pass that
 they did humble themselves before the Lord, and did give thanks
 unto him.
 
 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey,
 traveling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after
 we had traveled for the space of many days we did pitch our tents
 again, that we might tarry for the space of a time.
 
 And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the
 place which was called Nahom.
 
 And it came to pass that the daughters of Ishmael did mourn
 exceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because of
 their afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against
 my father, because he had brought them out of the land of
 Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and we have wandered
 much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction,
 hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings we
 must perish in the wilderness with hunger.
 
 And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against
 me; and they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem.
 
 And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael:
 Behold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who
 has taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are
 his elder brethren.
 
 Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that
 angels have ministered unto him. But behold, we know that he
 lies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many
 things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes,
 thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange
 wilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make
 himself a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us
 according to his will and pleasure. And after this manner did my
 brother Laman stir up their hearts to anger.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the
 voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and
 did chasten them exceedingly; and after they were chastened by
 the voice of the Lord they did turn away their anger, and did
 repent of their sins, insomuch that the Lord did bless us again
 with food, that we did not perish.
 
 
 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the
 wilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward from that time
 forth. And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the
 wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness.
 
 And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that
 while we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did
 give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea,
 even like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings
 without murmurings.
 
 And thus we see that the commandments of God must be
 fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the
 commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them,
 and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he
 has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while
 we did sojourn in the wilderness.
 
 And we did sojourn for the space of many years, yea, even
 eight years in the wilderness.
 
 And we did come to the land which we called Bountiful, because
 of its much fruit and also wild honey; and all these things were
 prepared of the Lord that we might not perish. And we beheld the
 sea, which we called Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is many
 waters.
 
 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the
 seashore; and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions
 and much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them
 all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the seashore;
 and we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit.
 
 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land
 of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord
 came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And
 it came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and
 cried unto the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou
 shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee,
 that I may carry thy people across these waters.
 
 And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to
 molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the
 manner which thou hast shown unto me?
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go
 to find ore, that I might make tools.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows
 wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I
 had made a bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire,
 I did smite two stones together that I might make fire.
 
 For the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make
 much fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he said: I will
 make thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not;
 
 And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will
 prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my
 commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my
 commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye
 shall know that it is by me that ye are led.
 
 Yea, and the Lord said also that: After ye have arrived in
 the promised land, ye shall know that I, the Lord, am God; and
 that I, the Lord, did deliver you from destruction; yea, that I
 did bring you out of the land of Jerusalem.
 
 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the commandments of
 the Lord, and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and
 diligence.
 
 And it came to pass that I did make tools of the ore which I
 did molten out of the rock.
 
 And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship,
 they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool,
 for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also
 thinketh that he can cross these great waters.
 
 And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were
 desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that
 I could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was
 instructed of the Lord.
 
 And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was exceedingly
 sorrowful because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when
 they saw that I began to be sorrowful they were glad in their
 hearts, insomuch that they did rejoice over me, saying: We knew
 that ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that ye were
 lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so
 great a work.
 
 And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish
 imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of
 Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for these many
 years; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they
 have borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things,
 save it were death; and it would have been better that they had
 died before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered
 these afflictions.
 
 Behold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness,
 which time we might have enjoyed our possessions and the land of
 our inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy.
 
 And we know that the people who were in the land of Jerusalem
 were a righteous people; for they kept the statutes and judgments
 of the Lord, and all his commandments, according to the law of
 Moses; wherefore, we know that they are a righteous people; and
 our father hath judged them, and hath led us away because we
 would hearken unto his words; yea, and our brother is like unto
 him. And after this manner of language did my brethren murmur
 and complain against us.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying:
 Do ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel,
 would have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if
 they had not hearkened unto the words of the Lord?
 
 Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of
 bondage, if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead
 them out of bondage?
 
 Now ye know that the children of Israel were in bondage; and
 ye know that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to
 be borne; wherefore, ye know that it must needs be a good thing
 for them, that they should be brought out of bondage.
 
 Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that
 great work; and ye know that by his word the waters of the Red
 Sea were divided hither and thither, and they passed through on
 dry ground.
 
 But ye know that the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea,
 who were the armies of Pharaoh.
 
 And ye also know that they were fed with manna in the
 wilderness.
 
 Yea, and ye also know that Moses, by his word according to
 the power of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came
 forth water, that the children of Israel might quench their
 thirst.
 
 And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their
 Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day and giving light
 unto them by night, and doing all things for them which were
 expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and
 blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the
 true and living God.
 
 And it came to pass that according to his word he did destroy
 them; and according to his word he did lead them; and according
 to his word he did do all things for them; and there was not any
 thing done save it were by his word.
 
 And after they had crossed the river Jordan he did make them
 mighty unto the driving out of the children of the land, yea,
 unto the scattering them to destruction.
 
 And now, do ye suppose that the children of this land, who
 were in the land of promise, who were driven out by our fathers,
 do ye suppose that they were righteous? Behold, I say unto you,
 Nay.
 
 Do ye suppose that our fathers would have been more choice
 than they if they had been righteous? I say unto you, Nay.
 
 Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is
 righteous is favored of God. But behold, this people had
 rejected every word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and
 the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did
 curse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea,
 he did curse it against them unto their destruction, and he did
 bless it unto our fathers unto their obtaining power over it.
 
 Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be
 inhabited; and he hath created his children that they should
 possess it.
 
 And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the
 nations of the wicked.
 
 And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and
 the wicked he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for
 their sakes.
 
 He ruleth high in the heavens, for it is his throne, and this
 earth is his footstool.
 
 And he loveth those who will have him to be their God.
 Behold, he loved our fathers, and he covenanted with them, yea,
 even Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants
 which he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land
 of Egypt.
 
 And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod; for
 they hardened their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord
 straitened them because of their iniquity. He sent fiery flying
 serpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way
 that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to
 perform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or
 the easiness of it, there were many who perished.
 
 And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they
 did revile against Moses, and also against God; nevertheless, ye
 know that they were led forth by his matchless power into the
 land of promise.
 
 And now, after all these things, the time has come that they
 have become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but
 they are at this day about to be destroyed; for I know that the
 day must surely come that they must be destroyed, save a few
 only, who shall be led away into captivity.
 
 Wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he should depart
 into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his
 life; yea, and ye also have sought to take away his life;
 wherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts and ye are like unto
 them.
 
 Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord
 your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye
 have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto
 you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye
 could not feel his words; wherefore, he has spoken unto you like
 unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as
 if it were to divide asunder.
 
 And ye also know that by the power of his almighty word he
 can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know
 that by his word he can cause the rough places to be made smooth,
 and smooth places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, that
 ye can be so hard in your hearts?
 
 Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of you, and my
 heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall be cast off forever.
 Behold, I am full of the Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame
 has no strength.
 
 And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words,
 they were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the
 depths of the sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon
 me I spake unto them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I
 command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power
 of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay
 his hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall
 be as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto them that they
 should murmur no more against their father; neither should they
 withhold their labor from me, for God had commanded me that I
 should build a ship.
 
 And I said unto them: If God had commanded me to do all
 things I could do them. If he should command me that I should
 say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I
 should say it, it would be done.
 
 And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so
 many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot
 instruct me, that I should build a ship?
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my
 brethren, insomuch that they were confounded and could not
 contend against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon me
 nor touch me with their fingers, even for the space of many days.
 
 Now they durst not do this lest they should wither before me, so
 powerful was the Spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon
 them.
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth
 thine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither
 before thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord, and this will
 I do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God.
 
 And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my
 brethren, and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did
 shake them, even according to the word which he had spoken.
 
 And now, they said: We know of a surety that the Lord is with
 thee, for we know that it is the power of the Lord that has
 shaken us. And they fell down before me, and were about to
 worship me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy
 brother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the
 Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days
 may be long in the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.
 
 
 And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go
 forth with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship.
 And the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I
 should work the timbers of the ship.
 
 Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which
 was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner
 of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had
 shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men.
 
 And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft
 unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things.
 
 And it came to pass that after I had finished the ship,
 according to the word of the Lord, my brethren beheld that it was
 good, and that the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine;
 wherefore, they did humble themselves again before the Lord.
 
 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
 father, that we should arise and go down into the ship.
 
 And it came to pass that on the morrow, after we had prepared
 all things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey
 in abundance, and provisions according to that which the Lord had
 commanded us, we did go down into the ship, with all our loading
 and our seeds, and whatsoever thing we had brought with us, every
 one according to his age; wherefore, we did all go down into the
 ship, with our wives and our children.
 
 And now, my father had begat two sons in the wilderness; the
 elder was called Jacob and the younger Joseph.
 
 And it came to pass after we had all gone down into the ship,
 and had taken with us our provisions and things which had been
 commanded us, we did put forth into the sea and were driven forth
 before the wind towards the promised land.
 
 And after we had been driven forth before the wind for the
 space of many days, behold, my brethren and the sons of Ishmael
 and also their wives began to make themselves merry, insomuch
 that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much
 rudeness, yea, even that they did forget by what power they had
 been brought thither; yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding
 rudeness.
 
 And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly lest the Lord should
 be angry with us, and smite us because of our iniquity, that we
 should be swallowed up in the depths of the sea; wherefore, I,
 Nephi, began to speak to them with much soberness; but behold
 they were angry with me, saying: We will not that our younger
 brother shall be a ruler over us.
 
 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and
 bind me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness;
 nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it that he might show forth his
 power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he had spoken
 concerning the wicked.
 
 And it came to pass that after they had bound me insomuch
 that I could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of
 the Lord, did cease to work.
 
 Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship,
 insomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and
 terrible tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters for the
 space of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly
 lest they should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless they did not
 loose me.
 
 And on the fourth day, which we had been driven back, the
 tempest began to be exceedingly sore.
 
 And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in
 the depths of the sea. And after we had been driven back upon
 the waters for the space of four days, my brethren began to see
 that the judgments of God were upon them, and that they must
 perish save that they should repent of their iniquities;
 wherefore, they came unto me, and loosed the bands which were
 upon my wrist, and behold they had swollen exceedingly; and also
 mine ankles were much swollen, and great was the soreness
 thereof.
 
 Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him
 all the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord because
 of mine afflictions.
 
 Now my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them, and also
 unto the sons of Ishmael; but, behold, they did breathe out much
 threatenings against anyone that should speak for me; and my
 parents being stricken in years, and having suffered much grief
 because of their children, they were brought down, yea, even upon
 their sick-beds.
 
 Because of their grief and much sorrow, and the iniquity of
 my brethren, they were brought near even to be carried out of
 this time to meet their God; yea, their grey hairs were about to
 be brought down to lie low in the dust; yea, even they were near
 to be cast with sorrow into a watery grave.
 
 And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having need of much
 nourishment, were grieved because of the afflictions of their
 mother; and also my wife with her tears and prayers, and also my
 children, did not soften the hearts of my brethren that they
 would loose me.
 
 And there was nothing save it were the power of God, which
 threatened them with destruction, could soften their hearts;
 wherefore, when they saw that they were about to be swallowed up
 in the depths of the sea they repented of the thing which they
 had done, insomuch that they loosed me.
 
 And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took
 the compass, and it did work whither I desired it. And it came
 to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the
 winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great
 calm.
 
 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that
 we sailed again towards the promised land.
 
 And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of
 many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth
 upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the
 promised land.
 
 And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and
 we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the
 earth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And it
 came to pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were
 blessed in abundance.
 
 And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of
 promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were
 beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and
 the ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all
 manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men. And we
 did find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of
 copper.
 
 
 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I
 did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record
 of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven
 the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the
 wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also many of
 mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.
 
 And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be
 commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record
 of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part
 of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those
 first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which
 transpired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more
 particularly made mention upon the first plates.
 
 And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I,
 Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the
 prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be
 written upon these plates; and that the things which were written
 should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should
 possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which
 purposes are known unto the Lord.
 
 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates,
 which gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the
 wars and contentions and destructions of my people. And this
 have I done, and commanded my people what they should do after I
 was gone; and that these plates should be handed down from one
 generation to another, or from one prophet to another, until
 further commandments of the Lord.
 
 And an account of my making these plates shall be given
 hereafter; and then, behold, I proceed according to that which I
 have spoken; and this I do that the more sacred things may be
 kept for the knowledge of my people.
 
 Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon plates save it be
 that I think it be sacred. And now, if I do err, even did they
 err of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men,
 but because of the weakness which is in me, according to the
 flesh, I would excuse myself.
 
 For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth,
 both to the body and soul, others set at naught and trample under
 their feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel do men trample
 under their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would
 speak in other words--they set him at naught, and hearken not to
 the voice of his counsels.
 
 And behold he cometh, according to the words of the angel, in
 six hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.
 
 And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to
 be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he
 suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they
 spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving
 kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.
 
 And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of
 bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea,
 the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth
 himself, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the
 hands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of
 Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and
 to be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos,
 which he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which
 should be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit
 the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of
 the house of Israel.
 
 For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit
 all the house of Israel at that day, some with his voice, because
 of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation, and
 others with the thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by
 tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by the
 opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up.
 
 And all these things must surely come, saith the prophet
 Zenos. And the rocks of the earth must rend; and because of the
 groanings of the earth, many of the kings of the isles of the sea
 shall be wrought upon by the Spirit of God, to exclaim: The God
 of nature suffers.
 
 And as for those who are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet,
 they shall be scourged by all people, because they crucify the
 God of Israel, and turn their hearts aside, rejecting signs and
 wonders, and the power and glory of the God of Israel.
 
 And because they turn their hearts aside, saith the prophet,
 and have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in
 the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be
 hated among all nations.
 
 Nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that
 they no more turn aside their hearts against the Holy One of
 Israel, then will he remember the covenants which he made to
 their fathers.
 
 Yea, then will he remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all
 the people who are of the house of Israel, will I gather in,
 saith the Lord, according to the words of the prophet Zenos, from
 the four quarters of the earth.
 
 Yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of the Lord,
 saith the prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue and people shall
 be blessed.
 
 And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that
 perhaps I might persuade them that they would remember the Lord
 their Redeemer.
 
 Wherefore, I speak unto all the house of Israel, if it so be
 that they should obtain these things.
 
 For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth weary
 me even that all my joints are weak, for those who are at
 Jerusalem; for had not the Lord been merciful, to show unto me
 concerning them, even as he had prophets of old, I should have
 perished also.
 
 And he surely did show unto the prophets of old all things
 concerning them; and also he did show unto many concerning us;
 wherefore, it must needs be that we know concerning them for they
 are written upon the plates of brass.
 
 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren
 these things; and it came to pass that I did read many things to
 them, which were engraven upon the plates of brass, that they
 might know concerning the doings of the Lord in other lands,
 among people of old.
 
 And I did read many things unto them which were written in
 the books of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to
 believe in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that
 which was written by the prophet Isaiah; for I did liken all
 scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning.
 
 Wherefore I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the
 prophet, ye who are a remnant of the house of Israel, a branch
 who have been broken off; hear ye the words of the prophet, which
 were written unto all the house of Israel, and liken them unto
 yourselves, that ye may have hope as
